Jokes aside the culture is revived in this club, playing for a european title or at least trying to progress as much in CL should be the goal while being sustainable financialy. This is a really high tier group of players with veterans and a younger group. Icardi rejecting tens of millions of euroes to stay here is massive as well. People should realise here that winning titles, living in a good city, playing in a big club with european football is a lot to take into account. I do believe icardi has a few more world class years ahead of him and i would argue since burak,drogba,sneijder we have the most dangerous squad to push top tier teams in europe.

**How will Mauro Icardi be remembered in Paris SG history?**,ParisLake2,1,0,2023-07-28 19:25:23
" After being loaned out to Galatasaray for the 2022-2023 season, Mauro Icardi is joining the Turkish club on a permanent deal.

Born in Rosario (Argentina) in 1993, Mauro Icardi left his homeland at the age of 9 for the Spanish island of Gran Canaria and Union Deportiva Vecindario. Between the ages of 15 and 17, he continued his training at FC Barcelona.

In January 2011, the Argentinian striker moved to Sampdoria, where he made 33 appearances, scoring 11 goals and providing 4 assists. He took his career to the next level by signing for Inter Milan in July 2013. The striker scored 124 goals and provided 28 assists in 219 appearances for the Nerazzurri. His performances earned him Serie A's top scorer award in 2015 and 2018.

The Albiceleste international joined Paris Saint-Germain at the start of the 2019-2020 season. With the Rouge & Bleu, Mauro Icardi made 92 appearances, scoring 38 goals in the process. In three seasons with the club from the capital, he won two French Championships (2020 and 2022), two Coupe de France (2020 and 2021), one Coupe de la Ligue (2020) and two Trophées des Champions (2020 and 2022).

Having joined Galatasaray on loan in September 2022, Mauro Icardi enjoyed a successful season, scoring 23 times in 26 matches in all competitions and winning the Turkish league title. He also provided 8 assists for the Istanbul outfit.

Paris Saint-Germain wish Mauro all the best for the rest of his career.",ParisLake2,1,0,2023-07-28 19:26:24

To reduce the spam of reports regarding the same move during transfer windows we try to allow **only one submission about each transfer saga per day**. The submission in question also needs to contain relevant new information regarding the potential move, and not just being a ""no/minor developments"" report.   

If there are important/official developments or new valuable information about a saga, we will allow extra threads in the same day, but for the rest of minor news please just comment them as a reply to this comment. Please help us reporting unnecessary threads for being duplicates.

"Unpopular opinion, I’ll probably get downvoted to hell but, bear with me just a second.
Let me preface that he is a pretty moronic guy and he could actually break the locker room but, from a tactical point of view (and considering that shitty settlement agreement we are bounded to), he would be the perfect fit for the team, our biggest problem this year was converting our chances into goals, basically the one thing he very good at, it’s true he doesn’t partecipate too much to the play (and this could be a problem considering how much our strikers are involved and how much they have to fight for the ball) but give him the ball in the area he will put it in the net, he’s deadly in the last 20 meters and I think that’s undeniable. All this to say that he would a pretty risky bet, it could work very good or it could bring more harm than good, however I wouldn’t be mad if we would get him.

It is nice to see him doing his icardi things in a better mindset but the only thing I wonder is if he was to stay with that club would the same outcome as he was in his last couple seasons with us or would he still attain his form.,Thenomfulhooman,2,0,2023-05-21 15:12:07

"**More:**

Icardi phoned Wanda Nara and demanded she put an end to this media farce, and return to Turkey. He called her a bad mother for leaving the 5 kids in Turkey, as she left by herself to Argentina. Mauro doesn’t know what to say anymore. He is both angry and sad. The angriest is Valentino, the 14 year old son of Wanda and Maxi Lopez. He has even unfollowed his mother on social media.

Wanda Nara will continue to be his agent, so they will still be tied professionally. As for Galatasaray, they are unhappy with Icardi’s behaviour, and there is a risk that Icardi’s time in Turkey ends earlier than planned.",ParisLake2,2804,0,2022-10-21 17:38:41

> 
> La relación entre [**Wanda Nara**](https://www.infobae.com/teleshow/2023/06/09/un-amigo-la-esta-pasando-mal-wanda-nara-rompio-el-silencio-tras-la-detencion-de-l-gante/)y [**Mauro Icardi**](https://www.infobae.com/teleshow/2023/06/06/el-reencuentro-emotivo-entre-wanda-nara-y-sus-hijas-y-el-frio-saludo-con-mauro-icardi/)suma, al parecer,[**una nueva reconciliación**](https://www.infobae.com/deportes/2023/05/18/la-contundente-respuesta-de-mauro-icardi-sobre-los-rumores-que-lo-vinculan-a-boca-juniors/) después de muchas idas y vueltas. Desde que se conoció el affaire del jugador del Galatasaray con [**Eugenia** _**China**_ **Suárez,**](https://www.infobae.com/teleshow/2023/06/03/la-tajante-respuesta-de-la-china-suarez-a-una-seguidora-que-le-marco-las-estrias-en-una-foto/) la pareja no para de sorprender con rupturas abruptas y acuerdos mutuos.
> 
> El año pasado cuando la empresaria regresó al país para cumplir con compromisos laborales, entre ellos conducir _Quién es la máscara_, el ciclo de entretenimientos liderado por **Natalia Oreiro** por Telefe y también llevar adelante las inauguraciones de sus locales de venta de su línea de cosmética, **se mostró separada del papá de sus hijas Francesca e Isabella.** En esa oportunidad, Wanda viajó sola a Argentina, mientras sus cinco hijos quedaron al cuidado de Icardi, recién instalado en ese momento en Turquía.
> 
> Durante la estadía de la mediática en el país, se la vio muy cerca de [**L-Gante**](https://www.infobae.com/teleshow/2023/06/09/l-gante-envio-una-carta-manuscrita-desde-su-detencion-para-presentar-su-nueva-cancion/), con quien estableció un vínculo de amistad, según ellos mismos dijeron. Aunque se mostraron muy juntos, [nunca blanquearon una relación de pareja](https://www.infobae.com/teleshow/2023/06/07/la-selfie-en-la-intimidad-de-mauro-icardi-con-wanda-nara-luego-del-frio-recibimiento-de-ella-en-su-llegada-a-la-argentina/)y se mantuvieron en la firme postura de ser solamente amigos. Sin embargo, Wanda protagonizó el videoclip que había lanzado el músico de cumbia 420, lo que despertó la ira del futbolista.
> 
> En aquella ocasión, desde Estambul, Mauro Icardi realizó un vivo a través de Instagram para explicar las razones por las que se encontraba distanciado de su esposa, y hasta le pidió que regrese lo antes posible. La empresaria hizo oídos sordos a su reclamo aunque a los pocos días viajó a Turquía para reencontrarse con sus hijos y también con su pareja.

> Wanda Nara y Mauro Icardi
> 
> Una vez más intentaron una reconciliación con un viaje paradisíaco a las Islas Maldivas, los dos solos. Pero al regreso, a través de su abogada **Ana Rosenfeld**, Wanda **se encargó de desmentir que estuvieran de nuevo juntos**. Ya para fin de año, la hermana de **Zaira Nara** viajó a Uruguay a pasar las fiestas con sus padres y sus hijos. Desde Punta del Este mostró el día a día de sus actividades junto a su hermana, hijos y sobrinos.
> 
> Luego regresó a Europa y pasó un tiempo junto a Icardi en familia, lo que hizo pensar en una nueva reconciliación entre ellos. Pero **la paz de la pareja duró poco tiempo.** Hace aproximadamente un mes surgió el rumor de un nuevo romance del jugador, esta vez con una joven argentina, **Candela Lecce.** Al parecer, en uno de sus viajes a Argentina a visitar a Wanda que está instalada como conductora de Masterchef (Telefe), el futbolista habría aprovechado la tarde libre de un sábado para ir a buscar a la joven hasta Olavarría y regresar a Puerto Madero para pasar parte de la noche con ella en un apart hotel.
> 
> Ese episodio despertó la furia de Icardi, quien negó los hechos aunque Candela mostró al aire de varios programas de televisión las capturas de los chats privados con el jugador de fútbol. En ese momento, **Wanda anunció por medio de Instagram que se encontraba separada del padre de sus hijas.**
> 
> [Cuando Mauro Icardi viajó al país, Wanda Nara lo recibió con un frío saludo (Instagram)](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/XAXC4JNIANFENLIUAOH6NRV42Q.jpg)
> 
> Cuando Mauro Icardi viajó al país, Wanda Nara lo recibió con un frío saludo (Instagram)
> 
> Durante un intercambio de preguntas y respuestas con sus seguidores, la mediática se mostró junto a su hermana Zaira contestando todo lo que le consultaban. En un momento dado, una de los interrogantes fue si estaba separada y la ahora morocha contestó contundente que “sí”.
> 
> Así las cosas, Wanda continuó en Argentina para seguir al frente del certamen de cocina y Mauro viajó a visitar a su familia. Por estas horas, la conductora **sorprendió con una publicación** en sus historias de Instagram en la que se la puede ver junto a su marido, en un alto de las grabaciones de _Masterchef._ La imagen lo muestra al futbolista sentado en una banqueta alta y a la empresaria parada adelante suyo, mientras Mauro le quita comida de un diente. Entonces, la mediática compartió esa foto con una frase que había escrito una seguidora. **“Quedate con el que te saque comida del diente. La tanga te la saca cualquiera”.**

"I know some of you guys hate stats but I love numbers so here is a fun (not so fun) fact:

Icardi had 0.56xG today and 0.61xG last game. That is 1.17xG.

Looking at data pre-earthquake break. He needed 0.7xG to score a goal.

So he would have scored 1 to 2 goals (more 2 than 1 [1.67])with the positions he had. 

You might say that this is just data normalizing itself, but quality players constantly over-perform their xG, and it passes the eye test that Icardi is far away from the player he was before the earthquake break.",thirdplanetperson,4,0,2023-03-17 19:42:29
