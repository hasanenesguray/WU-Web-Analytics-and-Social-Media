"I just think men don't like it when movies aren't catered to them. If a movie is too girly, people dismiss it as a chick flick, as if chick flicks are incapable of being entertaining to both genders.

"I believe the hate comes from your average military standard-issue misogyny. So far, no critic (one with a negative opinion of the film Barbie) has brought up interesting, complex, or otherwise important commentary on the film.

"Misogyny (and racism, homophobia, etc) really makes no sense. No matter what, the end goal is to hate on women, which is why the hate on Margot Robbie being ""too old"" is laughable.

Men can't stand if people who aren't white dudes exist in a movie, they can't stand if it's not about them.

"Oh it sure is a commercial but sugarcoated in the libfem notion of “feminist empowerment”. 

You see Barbie ads everywhere in internet and in real life. Every single fast-fashion company produced a Barbie collection this year. And the pr campaign started like last year?? Every single day we read more insignificant news about Barbie on the biggest news portals like some made up “scandals” like some companies ran out of pink paint or some other nonesense like that. Can you imagine how many companies sold enormous amounts of product, just for the commercial part tho? And I’m telling this as a feminist woman myself. This is a commercial. And Mattel is not only the antagonist of the movie, it is also one of the producers. It’s more like the commercial is the main product and the movie is just an excuse for all of it.

Capitalism will use everything, every notion in its own way, sometimes by degrading, sometimes by owning it. Feminism is (or must be) quite the opposite of capitalist society. But rather than making it the enemy visibly, system will look like it owns women’s rights in the form of “empowerment”, sell whatever it can out of it and will degrade the rest as “wokism”, “radicalism”, “crazyness” etc. By this way, no threat to the state or upper classes will be made but some people will get even richer.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to run defense for someone who is probably a sex trafficker, and definitely a disgusting human being, but I just grew up around so many people who were always talking about how wrong it was to shame people for their body size, facial features, and overall looks, but then Paris Hilton would do something stupid and they would immediately rush to how she's actually not attractive, and it was like.... bro, say what you want, but everyone I knew who said that would have chewed off all the fingers on their left hand to have a one nighter with her.

"That was very clever of her.

"I would agree but I really think Barbie’s chances are being way overestimated. It’s essentially the Top Gun: Maverick of the year whilst being more competitive in Screenplay and having a buzzed about supporting performance that will *probably* get nominated. 

I don’t at all understand why people think the Director’s branch who thought Dune was too commercial will suddenly go for a movie about a toy and, let’s be honest, one created mainly to sell more toys. Nor do I understand why people think Gosling will be in any way win competitive when he’s 100% a purely comedic performance the likes of which are rarely even nominated (before anyone brings her up, JLC in EEAAO had more emotional moments and had one of the most aggressive campaigns this side of Roma in addition to a much stronger narrative than Gosling).

With all that said, yes, I would agree that Robbie would definitely come along for the ride in case of Barbie doing really well and especially if Gerwig gets into Director. She’s the main character and shows a lot of range in the movie, including her emotional moment near the end that apparently made people cry. And if the strike continues into the winter, I could see Barbie benefit because it already has a lot of visibility.

"I agree she's so so good in this and really the performance of the movie. 

I do think there's been an element with Gosling's praise that is sort of ""hey get a load of this guy taking his work in a girl movie seriously"" - not that he's bad by any means but playing ""against"" type helps a performance gain notoriety. 

Margot Robbie's been an interesting actor for me because it really feels like she's so stereotypical as a Hollywood bombshell that it has been hard to escape that perception. It is ironic that some of her best roles in Harley Quinn and now Barbie has really been about not only engaging with a bimbo stereotype but embracing it. 

What she's doing in Barbie is so technical and precise and she makes it seem effortless. She could probably do 80% of what she's doing without dialogue. I think Bombshell as dunked on that movie is has a really great Robbie performance as well.

"Well, as far as I know, there are some actresses that are actually disliked by a good enough number of people (like Amber Heard). She is definitely not one of those - I think she is liked well enough. 

I don't think people will see a movie because she stars in it, but it does prove she can absolutely lead a film and enhance it, even if she is not THE reason people go see it.

I think it also proves the movies she was in actually were bad, their lack of success had nothing to do with her performance - she is perfectly fine with the right direction in the right movie.

And in my opinion, it also proves how misguided Hollywood is putting politics in movies. They put the wrong politics in the wrong movies. 

As in, they keep trying to put feminism in movies for a male audience - which is dumb: they only marginally attract more women, but they alienate a large part of the men who would've payed for it.
