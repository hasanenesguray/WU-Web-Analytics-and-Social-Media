"""Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence"" - Robert J. Hanlon

If you look into his history he's never actually managed any of his businesses, they are usually ran by people who know what they're doing,

In fact this could very likely be his first real job since graduating university,

On top of that Twitter is a software company, so you can make changes faster than people who know what they are doing can convince him not to, if you want to, let's say, slightly change how a car looks it will take a long time before the changes make it through so there's plenty of time for people who know better to come along and fix it,

Like Elons job has always been closer to marketing, using his persona and image as this genius visionary to attract talent, than it has been to actually managing anything (or engineering since he also loves to take credit for his employees work and claim he's involved in everything),

"I firmly believe there is no endgame. This whole debacle is the epitome of:

“It’s so dumb it’s brilliant! 
“No! It’s just dumb!” 

Musk has no experience in running a business of this nature. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX. They’re not REALLY public facing businesses in the same way Twitter is. Musk is, at his core, a software engineer, or a engineer generally if I am being generous. Twitter has massive exposure to engineering issues obviously, but it’s offering isn’t one you can improve through solving engineering issues. It hasn’t REALLY changed what it does for years, which is basically let people put text on the internet. That’s it. You are never going to revolutionise the core of that, nor should you want to, because if you do you’re losing the point of the platform in the first place. 

That’s why Twitter isn’t about engineering. It’s not about creating something people want to buy or use. Twitter is about people, it’s about communication, it’s about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. This isn’t something he can build. It’s something he has to understand. And he doesn’t understand it. 

He is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. All the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what HE wants and that he is so convinced of his own rightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

On some level, the idea of “X” as a one-stop shop app to do everything isn’t, necessarily, a terrible one. But it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbents which he will have to compete with. 

It’s going to be VERY hard to make those inroads but it isn’t necessarily impossible. However, the way to approach that challenge is NOT by turning off millions of people by taking edgy views on social issues. I for one will never use X in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain Musk is and I’m sure I’m not alone. 

The things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. I’m not saying he’s a bad businessman. He is incredibly successful and wealthy. Sure that could be down to luck, but I doubt all of it is. He has a set of skills. But they’re not relevant for Twitter and everything he’s done so far shouldn’t fill anyone with confidence.

"Tl;Dr: it’s very easy and somewhat common to self diagnose, sometimes ending it there, sometimes as a precursor to seeking an actual diagnosis.

A lot of people (especially women) self-diagnose autism in adulthood. For many of us, it’s all we can feasibly do. There’s a bunch of history and context behind it. Basically, for a long time, only very specific behaviors and differences were recognized as being indicative of autism. A lot of kids missed diagnosis because they appeared “normal”, “smart”, or “social” enough. Sometimes we were troublemakers, sometimes we were “gifted”, sometimes we were just “odd”. Sometimes our differences were internal and nobody realized we were struggling, but just barely succeeding to fit in.
As adults, we realize our experiences align significantly with others who were diagnosed young. Some people are fortunate enough to get evaluated by professionals, who can see through the mask and confirm. Some people don’t want the stigma of an official diagnosis, or encounter barriers to getting one because it’s costly and still viewed as more of a childhood thing.

Overall, Musk’s claim tracks. He certainly has a lot of autistic traits that people criticize him for (but that overall aren’t an excuse for his behavior, especially as an insanely wealthy public figure with a lot of power and influence). Either he’s had a diagnosis for a long time but didn’t talk about it (the stigma is still real, though fading and now almost “cool” in some circles, hence him announcing it), or he did realize it as an adult, and is either confident in his own assessment (unsurprisingly), or has been evaluated, formally or informally, by a professional. Or, he’s self diagnosed and wrong, perhaps playing up the traits he does have. Those traits are real though, I’m sure.

"Nah, it's all because he wants to pretend that his failed company from the late '90s, [x.com](https://x.com), is still around and successful.

Which, well, it isn't and it wasn't.  It failed, because it had zero products that anyone actually wanted, but had loads of money — because Daddy Musk got rich off Apartheid and his Emerald Mine — meaning that when a company called Confinity found that one of *their* products (PayPal) was getting really popular, but they didn't have the up-front money to expand fast enough to capture all that interest/business, the two companies merged.  Elon insisted that he be listed as a founder of PayPal (despite it existing before he got involved), and that the merged company still be called ""[x.com](https://x.com)"" (despite the only thing they provided being the money, not any of the products or customers).  However, users/customers thought that that name was stupid, and vaguely pornographic, so the company was quickly renamed to ""PayPal Inc"", and Musk was kicked out.

&#x200B;

He's an Investor, not an Innovator.  And his every attempt to pretend otherwise ends in disaster.

Why?

Because the Reddit Admins have decided that [they want to kill off all 3rd-party apps](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), [3rd-party bots, and everything else that makes Reddit barely usable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/).

So you'll just have to put up with automod and a worse overall user experience in the meantime.
