"Each individual post-Elon Twitter decision is my own personal brain worm, and I can't hold in my nerd rage any longer.

He's made read limits to stop scrapping? Read limiting on a modern social media site - a site that will passively load at least 10 tweets ahead on the activity you're currently on - sounds like an unfunny joke that a techy lib would make to dunk on twitter, but it's reality. He's weighing them all the same too; streaming a single video 10 minute video takes more data than pulling every single text tweet ever liked by the average twitter user, but you can do the former 300 times in 5 minutes, and the latter would take you weeks unless you pay for ~~Twitter~~ X Blue, because Elon doesn't understand the web.

Every single one of his changes is a lesson in best practice, because everything he's done is worst practice. Each choice he's made is both unorthodox and bad on its face. Twitter is now a pastiche of a disruptive startup except Elon legitimately does not understand *any* underlying concept required to run a social media website. 

Anyway it's gonna be funny when people link to media on Twitter, and the url is either ximg.com or video.ximg.com.

"I honestly believe this is what happened. Elon wanted to pump up Twitter stock by saying he was going to buy it for x amount, then short that stock and back out of the deal. The stock would have fallen a ton and he would make a ton. But his idiocy caught up to him and he was forced to go through with the deal.

Now he is stuck with a company that doesn't really make any money and is a money black hole. Maybe he can't dismantle it and sell off it's assets due to his ego or some contractual obligation, whatever reason he has decided he is going to ""run"" this company.

The problem is he has no idea how to run a company. Every other company he has bought has either been sold really fast for profit, or they quickly figured out how to handle Elon while still working. SpaceX had people who would make Elon's dumbass requests sound better, or make sense to the people actually working.

Problem is Twitter is not like that and is very public facing unlike his other ventures. So he makes an ass of himself and that hurts the company. He makes bad and worse decisions and that also hurts the company often leading to lawsuits and the situation where the dipshit fired the only guy who could do the security badges so the next day no one could get in.

"I firmly believe there is no endgame. This whole debacle is the epitome of:

“It’s so dumb it’s brilliant! 
“No! It’s just dumb!” 

Musk has no experience in running a business of this nature. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX. They’re not REALLY public facing businesses in the same way Twitter is. Musk is, at his core, a software engineer, or a engineer generally if I am being generous. Twitter has massive exposure to engineering issues obviously, but it’s offering isn’t one you can improve through solving engineering issues. It hasn’t REALLY changed what it does for years, which is basically let people put text on the internet. That’s it. You are never going to revolutionise the core of that, nor should you want to, because if you do you’re losing the point of the platform in the first place. 

That’s why Twitter isn’t about engineering. It’s not about creating something people want to buy or use. Twitter is about people, it’s about communication, it’s about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. This isn’t something he can build. It’s something he has to understand. And he doesn’t understand it. 

He is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. All the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what HE wants and that he is so convinced of his own rightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

On some level, the idea of “X” as a one-stop shop app to do everything isn’t, necessarily, a terrible one. But it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbents which he will have to compete with. 

It’s going to be VERY hard to make those inroads but it isn’t necessarily impossible. However, the way to approach that challenge is NOT by turning off millions of people by taking edgy views on social issues. I for one will never use X in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain Musk is and I’m sure I’m not alone. 

The things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. I’m not saying he’s a bad businessman. He is incredibly successful and wealthy. Sure that could be down to luck, but I doubt all of it is. He has a set of skills. But they’re not relevant for Twitter and everything he’s done so far shouldn’t fill anyone with confidence. Getting into a business and immediately alienating a sizeable proportion of its user base is, by any metric, a dumb move.",Joec1211,2,0,2023-07-24 20:30:07,"I firmly believe there is no endgame.

he is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. all the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what he wants and that he is so convinced of his own rightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

on some level, the idea of “x” as a one-stop shop app to do everything is not, necessarily, a terrible one. but it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbents which he will have to compete with. 

it is going to be very hard to make those inroads but it is not necessarily impossible. however, the way to approach that challenge is not by turning off millions of people by taking edgy views on social issues. i for one will never use x in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain musk is and i am sure i am not alone. 

the things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. i am not saying he is a bad businessman. he is incredibly successful and wealthy. sure that could be down to luck, but i doubt all of it is. he has a set of skills. but they are not relevant for twitter and everything he is done so far should not fill anyone with confidence. getting into a business and immediately alienating a sizeable proportion of its user base is, by any metric, a dumb move.","i firmly believe there is no engage. this whole debate is the episode of:

"You originally said he doesn’t have any degrees and now you’re discrediting him for his degrees being bachelor’s degrees. 

“Overseeing doesn’t mean anything,” is just another way of discrediting an important role within a company, yet you’re still wrong. Gwynne Shotwell, President and COO of SpaceX is in charge of overseeing the company, not Elon. Elon Musk is the Chief Engineer and CTO at SpaceX, directly involved and in charge of the engineering and technology within SpaceX, including hands on work with the rockets and their propulsion systems.

"Tl;Dr: it’s very easy and somewhat common to self diagnose, sometimes ending it there, sometimes as a precursor to seeking an actual diagnosis.

A lot of people (especially women) self-diagnose autism in adulthood. For many of us, it’s all we can feasibly do. There’s a bunch of history and context behind it. Basically, for a long time, only very specific behaviors and differences were recognized as being indicative of autism. A lot of kids missed diagnosis because they appeared “normal”, “smart”, or “social” enough. Sometimes we were troublemakers, sometimes we were “gifted”, sometimes we were just “odd”. Sometimes our differences were internal and nobody realized we were struggling, but just barely succeeding to fit in.
As adults, we realize our experiences align significantly with others who were diagnosed young. Some people are fortunate enough to get evaluated by professionals, who can see through the mask and confirm. Some people don’t want the stigma of an official diagnosis, or encounter barriers to getting one because it’s costly and still viewed as more of a childhood thing.

Overall, Musk’s claim tracks. He certainly has a lot of autistic traits that people criticize him for (but that overall aren’t an excuse for his behavior, especially as an insanely wealthy public figure with a lot of power and influence). Either he’s had a diagnosis for a long time but didn’t talk about it (the stigma is still real, though fading and now almost “cool” in some circles, hence him announcing it), or he did realize it as an adult, and is either confident in his own assessment (unsurprisingly), or has been evaluated, formally or informally, by a professional. Or, he’s self diagnosed and wrong, perhaps playing up the traits he does have. Those traits are real though, I’m sure. They just may or may not be related to autism.",elvenfaery_,2,0,2023-07-24 21:47:09,"Tl;Dr: it is very easy and somewhat common to self diagnose, sometimes ending it there, sometimes as a precursor to seeking an actual diagnosis.

Musk non è assolutamente cresciuto povero, ma dalla famiglia ha avuto 28000 per avviare la sua prima attività. Quella è stata venuta per 130 milioni, con la sua quota Musk ha co-fondato PayX che poi si è fusa con PayPal, da questo Musk ha preso 180 milioni, con 100 milioni ha fondato SpaceX e qualche anno dopo è entrato in Tesla al primo round di finanziamenti come azionista di maggioranza e presidente del CdA, è diventato CEO nel 2009 e da lì l'azienda è esplosa.

"> SpaceX è stata fondata con meno di 100 milioni di dollari, cifra che una marea di singoli imprenditori avevano a disposizione, figurarsi una cordata di investitori.

Non è che ti devo spiegare io perché non è successo. Evidentemente altri investitori con accesso a quei capitali o non erano interessati o avevano altre idee che consideravano più redditizie o meno rischiose. 

Io, personalmente ho un'indole lontana dall'imprenditoria per inclinazione personale, infatti lavoro in un campo che per certi versi è antitetico al profitto, ovvero la ricerca. Era solo per dire che se per qualche miracolo avessi accesso a centinaia di milioni di euro, allora ci penserei anche io perché ho la stessa passione verso lo spazio. Non voglio essere il più ricco del cimitero, come ho letto su IPF. 

Beninteso come ho scritto altrove che secondo me questo specifico settore, lo spazio, sia più giusto mantenere sotto ""l'egida"" pubblica. Quindi realisticamente se decine di anni fa avessi comprato decine di migliaia bitcoin e li avessi liquidati nel 2021, probabilmente li userei per mettere su una fondazione no-profit con cui finanziare la ricerca accademica in quel settore. Più un paio di milioncini per finanziare un piccolo studio di videogiochi :D Ma appunto, non per fare necessariamente i soldi, ma per una questione artistica, che è più vicina alla mia personalità.

> Tesla medesima storia. [...] Certamente un caso.

Il caso di Tesla è diverso. Non mi sembra che altre aziende non abbiano investito a sufficienza nel settore elettrico. Magari puoi darmi qualche motivazione razionale per cui la valutazione superiore a quella delle altre compagnie messe insieme che ha Tesla è giustificata. Non puoi neanche sottovalutare gli aiuti del governo USA.

> Fosse per la NASA su Marte ci andremo nel 2000 e credici.

Prima di tutto, in quanto Europeo non mi inserirei nell' ""andremo"" di cui parli li sopra. A meno che tu non sia Americano, ""loro"" ci ""andranno"" su Marte in futuro. Noi Europei, chissà. Spero presto.

Non vedo il nesso con Musk. Cosa c'entra Musk con Marte a parte i suoi tweet stramboidi al riguardo? Se la Nasa volesse andare su Marte potrebbe farlo. Anche l'ESA potrebbe riuscirci.

"> Evidentemente altri investitori con accesso a quei capitali o non erano interessati o avevano altre idee che consideravano più redditizie o meno rischiose.

Come vedi siamo ben oltre il ""metterci solo i soldi"". La propensione al rischio di Elon Musk è elevatissima e questo già è un merito di per sè. Pressoché la totalità di questi imprenditori realizzati con tutti quei soldi stanno in un'isola a fare la bella vita. Decidere di rischiare una ricchezza così elevata è estremamente apprezzabile e tutt'altro che scontato. Quando Musk ha ottenuto i proventi dalla vendita di PayPal ha suddiviso per intero il denaro tra Tesla e SpaceX. Solo un matto visionario farebbe una cosa del genere. Tuttavia, non è questo il punto, perché stiamo ancora parlando di allocazione di capitale e sono profondamente convinto che Musk abbia contribuito enormemente di più rispetto a questa singola skill. Non penso di poterti convincere del perché la visione, l'esecuzione di una strategia e anche il contributo tecnico diretto agli albori rappresentino tutto per il successo delle aziende. Lo si può capire solo studiando le storie e il funzionamento delle startup, in generale studiando l'ambito economico-aziendale. Te da ricercatore (non so in cosa, ma basta la parola per avere la mia stima) hai una prospettiva diversa e lo rispetto, personalmente i miei studi vertono su questo, e posso assicurarti che c'è una percezione molto distorta del contributo delle persone coinvolte in queste aziende di successo. Sicuramente la mitizzazione dei singoli è sbagliata, nessuno si sogna di attribuire tutti i meriti ai fondatori e dirigenti, tuttavia anche l'estremo opposto è sbagliato. Il contributo dei fondatori è determinante, e spessissimo prevede avere le mani in pasta. Per esempio, se AirBnb e Apple sono conosciute per il design eccellente dei propri prodotti e interfacce è perché Brian Chesky e Steve Jobs non si sono limitati solo a metterci i soldi e a dire a un mucchio di dipendenti specializzati ""realizzate un prodotto iconico"". Senza un orientamento non si va da nessuna parte. 

> Il caso di Tesla è diverso. Non mi sembra che altre aziende non abbiano investito a sufficienza nel settore elettrico. Magari puoi darmi qualche motivazione razionale per cui la valutazione superiore a quella delle altre compagnie messe insieme che ha Tesla è giustificata. Non puoi neanche sottovalutare gli aiuti del governo USA. 

C'è tanta disinformazione al riguardo. Tesla ha ricevuto un prestito governativo ripagato con 9 anni di anticipo rispetto alla scadenza dopo la crisi del 2009 e non per essere salvata dalla bancarotta (a differenza di Chrysler e General Motors) ma nell'ambito di un piano di sviluppo di mobilità sostenibile promosso dall'amministrazione Obama. Ha dato un impulso? Sicuramente. Era necessario per la sopravvivenza dell'azienda? No. Ci ha guadagnato più Tesla o gli Stati Uniti che si ritrovano con il leader indiscusso della rivoluzione elettrica? Direi la seconda. SpaceX stesso discorso. Molti detrattori sostengono che SpaceX esista solo grazie ai ""sussidi"" della NASA. Peccato che in cambio la NASA abbia ottenuto un fracco di missioni sulla ISS a costi dimezzati (parliamo di 30-40 milioni di risparmio per ogni singolo lancio) e l'indipendenza dalla Russia. Immagina che vergogna per gli USA dal 2011 dipendere dalla Russia per lanciare gli astronauti sulla ISS.

Comunque, la valutazione di Tesla incorpora il dominio che avrà in futuro. Ha un'infrastruttura di ricarica impareggiabile, tant'è che ora tutti i produttori tradizionali di recente hanno siglato accordi per accedere al network di Tesla (e si stanno convertendo allo standard NACS), con Ford apripista. Sono palate di fee solo per il fatto di disporre dell'infrastruttura. Per la guida autonoma hanno recentemente aperto al licensing, siccome i produttori tradizionali stanno fallendo (guarda Ford con Argo AI). Quando la guida autonoma sarà matura (e lo sarà), il modello robotaxi (mandi la tua auto a fare il taxi per conto tuo) sono palate di soldi, perché è come l'Apple store, dove prendi una fetta di un valore abnorme generato da altri. Oppure di Uber, ma senza la necessità di spendere un macello di incentivi in denaro nell'acquisizione dei clienti (autisti). Il business assicurativo sono altre palate di soldi, Tesla ha un vantaggio competitivo con la telemetria dei veicoli, consente di essere molto più accurata nel pricing delle polizze assicurative (che vuol dire premi più ridotti). Ed è un flusso di reddito che cresce all'aumentare dei veicoli Tesla venduti in maniera cumulata. Il prezzo rispetto agli utili del titolo azionario (metrica principale usata per valutare un investimento) oramai non è neanche così alto. NVIDIA, AMD e Amazon sono molto più care al momento per esempio.

Because the Reddit Admins have decided that [they want to kill off all 3rd-party apps](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), [3rd-party bots, and everything else that makes Reddit barely usable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/).

Because the Reddit Admins have decided that [they want to kill off all 3rd-party apps](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), [3rd-party bots, and everything else that makes Reddit barely usable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/).

"Bro, saying it came from a lab IS questioning what the government and media told me. I've been saying it was made in a lab for 3 years now. And back then, I was called racist for doing so because everyone and their brother was talking about the bat theory. And if you even suggested it came from a chinese lab, you would get banned from every social media platform, including reddit. 

But sure, go on thinking a random dude eating a bat caused the pandemic. That sure makes a ton of sense. Dont question the media narrative that was identical to the government messaging for 2 years, and was the only train of thought that was allowed to be had on the internet during that time. Dont question why Fauci was involved with gain of function research in china, and then he became one of the loudest guys to condemn the lab leak theory. Dont question anything, just eat it all up.

My guy you ever think this is why you don't have issues with Elon.... thanks for taking multiple posts to get to my point. Because conservatives don't have an issue with him because you all believe the exact same shit because you live in or operate in echo chambers..

Coming to Reddit doesn't change that specifically if you come with the thought process that you have some individuality that people who disagree with you don't.

I bet I could guess many other things you believe because you are nowhere near as individualistic as you think. You're being downvoted because people don't like what you say and that's what happens on Reddit

Une fois je me suis retrouvé à faire un blablacar avec un gamin d'une vingtaine d'années qui venait faire ses études en France (études de commerce). Il venait de Guinée Conakry et m'expliquait que sa famille était dans l'extraction du diamant et qu'on l'avait envoyé faire des études de commerce en Europe pour pouvoir faciliter la revente de ce genre de produits (et court-circuiter les intermédiaires). J'étais évidemment un peu dubitatif, mais là il commence à me montrer les photos que son frangin lui envoie sur Messenger (on était tous les deux passagers à l'arrière de la voiture). 

Et là, je vois des photos de cailloux gros comme des oeufs de caille. Il m'explique que le diamant de Guinée est peu réputé chez les joalliers et qu'il est surtout utilisé dans l'industrie mais qu'on trouve quand même parfois de belles pièces. Et il commence à me faire un cours sur les diamants. Du coup, je le questionne un peu et il m'explique qu'en gros l'extraction de diamant en Guinée c'est administrativement très simple mais logistiquement très compliqué. Sa famille est entièrement dans le business de l'extraction. Pour acheminer et entretenir les machines nécessaires à l'extraction, il y a des coûts gigantesques. Et il m'explique qu'en gros, des membres de sa famille prospectent en surface et quand ils trouvent un endroit potentiellement intéressant, ils mettent en branle toute la machinerie. 

Il m'expliquait qu'il y a plein d'arrangements avec les responsables locaux : si on veut pouvoir s'installer quelque part et creuser, il faut d'abord promettre l'embauche d'un certain nombre d'ouvriers locaux. Et avec ces ouvriers, il y a un intéressement pour ceux qui trouveraient les plus grosses pièces. Pour éviter la fauche de gros cailloux, les contremaitres proposent des primes en nature (carburant voire véhicules). 

Le mec m'expliquait aussi qu'ils n'allaient pas creuser très profond et que c'était plus intéressant de multiplier les zones d'extraction vu le matériel qu'ils avaient. 

En gros, les choses avaient l'air assez simple niveau légalité. 

Je n'ai aucun moyen de vérifier les dires du gamin. Mais vu les photos qu'il m'a montré et les détails qu'il donnait, ça avait l'air plutôt crédible.",morinl,9,0,2023-07-24 08:52:51,"Juste pour l'anecdote :
