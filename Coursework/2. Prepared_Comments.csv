Twitter would be 100% fine if Elon could just stop shaking the snowglobe. Nobody wants to use fucking Threads or Bluesky. Just stop fucking with the formula for 2 seconds and people will use Twitter like they always have.

"Each individual post-Elon Twitter decision is my own personal brain worm, and I can't hold in my nerd rage any longer.

He's made read limits to stop scrapping? Read limiting on a modern social media site - a site that will passively load at least 10 tweets ahead on the activity you're currently on - sounds like an unfunny joke that a techy lib would make to dunk on twitter, but it's reality. He's weighing them all the same too; streaming a single video 10 minute video takes more data than pulling every single text tweet ever liked by the average twitter user, but you can do the former 300 times in 5 minutes, and the latter would take you weeks unless you pay for ~~Twitter~~ X Blue, because Elon doesn't understand the web.

Every single one of his changes is a lesson in best practice, because everything he's done is worst practice. Each choice he's made is both unorthodox and bad on its face. Twitter is now a pastiche of a disruptive startup except Elon legitimately does not understand *any* underlying concept required to run a social media website. 

Anyway it's gonna be funny when people link to media on Twitter, and the url is either ximg.com or video.ximg.com.

"Well, WeChat is pretty intense. Just one app and you can do literally anything and it does it very well and is accepted anywhere. Like you can refinance your house while texting your grandma and playing a phone game all within WeChat, and it’s super developed within China

Wanna pay? Just use your phone. Scan tickets for the movies? Phone. Pick up food and then open your apartments? Phone. Subway or other public transit? You can't fucking use it and it sticks out like a sore thumb but whatever

But this only happened tbh in part because it replaced texting like blackberry and the iPhone did, but then they integrated a bunch of extra shit

"I honestly believe this is what happened. Elon wanted to pump up Twitter stock by saying he was going to buy it for x amount, then short that stock and back out of the deal. The stock would have fallen a ton and he would make a ton. But his idiocy caught up to him and he was forced to go through with the deal.

Now he is stuck with a company that doesn't really make any money and is a money black hole. Maybe he can't dismantle it and sell off it's assets due to his ego or some contractual obligation, whatever reason he has decided he is going to ""run"" this company.

The problem is he has no idea how to run a company. Every other company he has bought has either been sold really fast for profit, or they quickly figured out how to handle Elon while still working. SpaceX had people who would make Elon's dumbass requests sound better, or make sense to the people actually working.

Problem is Twitter is not like that and is very public facing unlike his other ventures. So he makes an ass of himself and that hurts the company. He makes bad and worse decisions and that also hurts the company often leading to lawsuits and the situation where the dipshit fired the only guy who could do the security badges so the next day no one could get in.

"""Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence"" - Robert J. Hanlon

If you look into his history he's never actually managed any of his businesses, they are usually ran by people who know what they're doing,

In fact this could very likely be his first real job since graduating university,

On top of that Twitter is a software company, so you can make changes faster than people who know what they are doing can convince him not to, if you want to, let's say, slightly change how a car looks it will take a long time before the changes make it through so there's plenty of time for people who know better to come along and fix it,

Like Elons job has always been closer to marketing, using his persona and image as this genius visionary to attract talent, than it has been to actually managing anything (or engineering since he also loves to take credit for his employees work and claim he's involved in everything),

“It’s so dumb it’s brilliant! 
“No! It’s just dumb!” 

Musk has no experience in running a business of this nature. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX. They’re not REALLY public facing businesses in the same way Twitter is. Musk is, at his core, a software engineer, or a engineer generally if I am being generous. Twitter has massive exposure to engineering issues obviously, but it’s offering isn’t one you can improve through solving engineering issues. It hasn’t REALLY changed what it does for years, which is basically let people put text on the internet. That’s it. You are never going to revolutionise the core of that, nor should you want to, because if you do you’re losing the point of the platform in the first place. 

That’s why Twitter isn’t about engineering. It’s not about creating something people want to buy or use. Twitter is about people, it’s about communication, it’s about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. This isn’t something he can build. It’s something he has to understand. And he doesn’t understand it. 

He is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. All the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what HE wants and that he is so convinced of his own rightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

On some level, the idea of “X” as a one-stop shop app to do everything isn’t, necessarily, a terrible one. But it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbents which he will have to compete with. 

It’s going to be VERY hard to make those inroads but it isn’t necessarily impossible. However, the way to approach that challenge is NOT by turning off millions of people by taking edgy views on social issues. I for one will never use X in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain Musk is and I’m sure I’m not alone. 

The things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. I’m not saying he’s a bad businessman. He is incredibly successful and wealthy. Sure that could be down to luck, but I doubt all of it is. He has a set of skills. But they’re not relevant for Twitter and everything he’s done so far shouldn’t fill anyone with confidence. Getting into a business and immediately alienating a sizeable proportion of its user base is, by any metric, a dumb move.",Joec1211,2,0,2023-07-24 20:30:07,"I firmly believe there is no endgame.

Twitter has massive exposure to engineering issues obviously, but it is offering is not one you can improve through solving engineering issues. It has not REALLY changed what it does for years, which is basically let people put text on the internet. That is it. You are never going to revolutions the core of that, nor should you want to, because if you do you are losing the point of the platform in the first place.   That is why Twitter is not about engineering. It is not about creating something people want to buy or use. Twitter is about people, it is about communication, it is about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. His is not something he can build. It is something he has to understand. And he does not understand it.   He is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. All the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what of wants and that he is so convinced of his own brightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line.   In some level, the idea of “X” as a one-stop shop pp to do everything is not, necessarily, a terrible one. But it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbent which he will have to compete with.   It is going to be VERY hard to make those inroads but it is not necessarily impossible. However, the way to approach that challenge is NOT by turning off millions of people by taking edge views on social issues. I for one will never use X in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain Dusk is and I am sure I am not alone.   The things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. I am not saying he is a bad businessman. He is incredibly successful and wealthy. Sure that could be down to luck, but I doubt all of it is. He has a set of skill. But they are not relevant for Twitter and everything he is done so far should not fill anyone with confidence. Getting into a business and immediately alienating a sizeable proportion of its user base is, by any merit, a dumb move.","i firmly believe there is no engage. his whole debate is the episode of:  “it is so dumb it is brilliant!

It is a colossal barrier to entry for any competitor and is Twitter's most valuable asset even though it's completely intangible. The Twitter launch in 2006/2007 was one of the most well crafted and beautifully executed campaigns of all time. It should be written about in marketing textbooks and studied in business schools. Honestly, Ashton Kutcher should have been made CEO of Twitter cuz he did more to get users to sign up that crucial first year than anybody that works there. Threads didn't have such a campaign. They instead tried to take advantage of people's frustrations with Musk which just isn't a strong enough force to get a critical mass of people to switch.

"The other fundamental issue is that Twitter has never been profitable.  It's relied on investors for capitol.

"Tl;Dr: it’s very easy and somewhat common to self diagnose, sometimes ending it there, sometimes as a precursor to seeking an actual diagnosis.

A lot of people (especially women) self-diagnose autism in adulthood. For many of us, it’s all we can feasibly do. There’s a bunch of history and context behind it. Basically, for a long time, only very specific behaviors and differences were recognized as being indicative of autism. A lot of kids missed diagnosis because they appeared “normal”, “smart”, or “social” enough. Sometimes we were troublemakers, sometimes we were “gifted”, sometimes we were just “odd”. Sometimes our differences were internal and nobody realized we were struggling, but just barely succeeding to fit in.
As adults, we realize our experiences align significantly with others who were diagnosed young. Some people are fortunate enough to get evaluated by professionals, who can see through the mask and confirm. Some people don’t want the stigma of an official diagnosis, or encounter barriers to getting one because it’s costly and still viewed as more of a childhood thing.

Overall, Musk’s claim tracks. He certainly has a lot of autistic traits that people criticize him for (but that overall aren’t an excuse for his behavior, especially as an insanely wealthy public figure with a lot of power and influence). Either he’s had a diagnosis for a long time but didn’t talk about it (the stigma is still real, though fading and now almost “cool” in some circles, hence him announcing it), or he did realize it as an adult, and is either confident in his own assessment (unsurprisingly), or has been evaluated, formally or informally, by a professional. Or, he’s self diagnosed and wrong, perhaps playing up the traits he does have. Those traits are real though, I’m sure. They just may or may not be related to autism.",elvenfaery_,2,0,2023-07-24 21:47:09,"Tl;Dr: it is very easy and somewhat common to self diagnose, sometimes ending it there, sometimes as a precursor to seeking an actual diagnosis.

"Genio è una parola grossa, secondo me.       
Ad avere già parecchio capitale e poter pagare abbastanza i dipendenti da attirarli non mi sembra rocket science.

Può essere tranquillamente dovuto anche all'aver venduto bene l'immagine, tant'è che sono in molti a considerare le azioni tesla come sopravvalutate e destinate prima o poi a crollare.

"Le quali non hanno lo stesso livello di userbase di X/Twitter. 

Per fare un paragone, è come avere un negozi in un centro commerciae o avere la propria attività in una zona industriale.

Certo, chi ha le idee decise va nelle zone industriali, perché sa cosa vuole ed è già ben deciso. Ma se vuoi farti conoscere twitter era (?) Un must have. Non esisteva nessun social che dava tanta visibilità ad un disegnatore come Twitter.

Con i limiti dei post visualizzati twitter era diventato un centro commerciale ""a minutaggio"". Se ""perdevi tempo"" a guardare post di ""H&M"" non vedevi più altri negozi come ""Calzedonia"" (esempi ad cazzum).

Con l'abbandono degli inserzionisti, è come se un centro commerciale avesse smesso, di offrire servizi.

Con il licenziamento dei team di moderazione, hanno licenziato gli uomini delle pulizie.

Con il rebranding, hanno cambiato nome e fatto perdere senso al centro commerciale.

In pratica, ad oggi, X (scusami la terminologia) è un porcile, nel quale non puoi nemmeno più cercare diamanti tra gli escrementi. 

Prima, usavo Twitter per seguire determinati Creatori. Un esempio è che seguivo dei creatori di Arcade Stick, che facevano prevendite limitate sui prodotti. (In batch, quindi se eri fuori, GG, se preordinavi ti arrivava)

"> SpaceX è stata fondata con meno di 100 milioni di dollari, cifra che una marea di singoli imprenditori avevano a disposizione, figurarsi una cordata di investitori.

Non è che ti devo spiegare io perché non è successo. Evidentemente altri investitori con accesso a quei capitali o non erano interessati o avevano altre idee che consideravano più redditizie o meno rischiose. 

Io, personalmente ho un'indole lontana dall'imprenditoria per inclinazione personale, infatti lavoro in un campo che per certi versi è antitetico al profitto, ovvero la ricerca. Era solo per dire che se per qualche miracolo avessi accesso a centinaia di milioni di euro, allora ci penserei anche io perché ho la stessa passione verso lo spazio. Non voglio essere il più ricco del cimitero, come ho letto su IPF. 

Beninteso come ho scritto altrove che secondo me questo specifico settore, lo spazio, sia più giusto mantenere sotto ""l'egida"" pubblica. Quindi realisticamente se decine di anni fa avessi comprato decine di migliaia bitcoin e li avessi liquidati nel 2021, probabilmente li userei per mettere su una fondazione no-profit con cui finanziare la ricerca accademica in quel settore. Più un paio di milioncini per finanziare un piccolo studio di videogiochi :D Ma appunto, non per fare necessariamente i soldi, ma per una questione artistica, che è più vicina alla mia personalità.

> Tesla medesima storia. [...] Certamente un caso.

Il caso di Tesla è diverso. Non mi sembra che altre aziende non abbiano investito a sufficienza nel settore elettrico. Magari puoi darmi qualche motivazione razionale per cui la valutazione superiore a quella delle altre compagnie messe insieme che ha Tesla è giustificata. Non puoi neanche sottovalutare gli aiuti del governo USA.

Prima di tutto, in quanto Europeo non mi inserirei nell' ""andremo"" di cui parli li sopra. A meno che tu non sia Americano, ""loro"" ci ""andranno"" su Marte in futuro. Noi Europei, chissà. Spero presto.

Pressoché la totalità di questi imprenditori realizzati con tutti quei soldi stanno in un'isola a fare la bella vita. Decidere di rischiare una ricchezza così elevata è estremamente apprezzabile e tutt'altro che scontato. Quando Musk ha ottenuto i proventi dalla vendita di PayPal ha suddiviso per intero il denaro tra Tesla e SpaceX. Solo un matto visionario farebbe una cosa del genere. Tuttavia, non è questo il punto, perché stiamo ancora parlando di allocazione di capitale e sono profondamente convinto che Musk abbia contribuito enormemente di più rispetto a questa singola skill. Non penso di poterti convincere del perché la visione, l'esecuzione di una strategia e anche il contributo tecnico diretto agli albori rappresentino tutto per il successo delle aziende.

Sicuramente la mitizzazione dei singoli è sbagliata, nessuno si sogna di attribuire tutti i meriti ai fondatori e dirigenti, tuttavia anche l'estremo opposto è sbagliato.

Decidere di rischiare una ricchezza così elevata è estremamente apprezzabile e tutt'altro che scontato. Quando Musk ha ottenuto i proventi dalla vendita di PayPal ha suddiviso per intero il denaro tra Tesla e SpaceX. Solo un matto visionario farebbe una cosa del genere. Tuttavia, non è questo il punto, perché stiamo ancora parlando di allocazione di capitale e sono profondamente convinto che Musk abbia contribuito enormemente di più rispetto a questa singola skill. Non penso di poterti convincere del perché la visione, l'esecuzione di una strategia e anche il contributo tecnico diretto agli albori rappresentino tutto per il successo delle aziende. Lo si può capire solo studiando le storie e il funzionamento delle startup, in generale studiando l'ambito economico-aziendale. Te da ricercatore (non so in cosa, ma basta la parola per avere la mia stima) hai una prospettiva diversa e lo rispetto, personalmente i miei studi vertono su questo, e posso assicurarti che c'è una percezione molto distorta del contributo delle persone coinvolte in queste aziende di successo. Sicuramente la mitizzazione dei singoli è sbagliata, nessuno si sogna di attribuire tutti i meriti ai fondatori e dirigenti, tuttavia anche l'estremo opposto è sbagliato. Il contributo dei fondatori è determinante, e spessissimo prevede avere le mani in pasta. Per esempio, se AirBnb e Apple sono conosciute per il design eccellente dei propri prodotti e interfacce è perché Brian Chesky e Steve Jobs non si sono limitati solo a metterci i soldi e a dire a un mucchio di dipendenti specializzati ""realizzate un prodotto iconico"". Senza un orientamento non si va da nessuna parte.   > Il caso di Tesla è diverso. Non mi sembra che altre aziende non abbiano investito a sufficienza nel settore elettrico. Magari puoi darmi qualche motivazione razionale per cui la valutazione superiore a quella delle altre compagnie messe insieme che ha Tesla è giustificata. Non puoi neanche sottovalutare gli aiuti del governo USA.   C'è tanta disinformazione al riguardo. Tesla ha ricevuto un prestito governativo ripagato con [SIZE] anni di anticipo rispetto alla scadenza dopo la crisi del [SIZE] e non per essere salvata dalla bancarotta (a differenza di Chrysler e General Motors) ma nell'ambito di un piano di sviluppo di mobilità sostenibile promosso dall'amministrazione Obama. Ha dato un impulso? Sicuramente. Era necessario per la sopravvivenza dell'azienda? No. Ci ha guadagnato più Tesla o gli Stati Uniti che si ritrovano con il leader indiscusso della rivoluzione elettrica? Direi la seconda. SpaceX stesso discorso. Molti detrattori sostengono che SpaceX esista solo grazie ai ""sussidi"" della NASA. Peccato che in cambio la NASA abbia ottenuto un fracco di missioni sulla ISS a costi dimezzati (parliamo di [SIZE]-[SIZE] milioni di risparmio per ogni singolo lancio) e l'indipendenza dalla Russia. Immagina che vergogna per gli USA dal [SIZE] dipendere dalla Russia per lanciare gli astronauti sulla ISS.  Comunque, la valutazione di Tesla incorpora il dominio che avrà in futuro. Ha un'infrastruttura di ricarica impareggiabile, tant'è che ora tutti i produttori tradizionali di recente hanno siglato accordi per accedere al network di Tesla (e si stanno convertendo allo standard NACS), con Ford apripista. Sono palate di fee solo per il fatto di disporre dell'infrastruttura. Per la guida autonoma hanno recentemente aperto al licensing, siccome i produttori tradizionali stanno fallendo (guarda Ford con Argo AI). Quando la guida autonoma sarà matura (e lo sarà), il modello robotaxi (mandi la tua auto a fare il taxi per conto tuo) sono palate di soldi, perché è come l'Apple store, dove prendi una fetta di un valore abnorme generato da altri. Oppure di Uber, ma senza la necessità di spendere un macello di incentivi in denaro nell'acquisizione dei clienti (autisti). Il business assicurativo sono altre palate di soldi, Tesla ha un vantaggio competitivo con la telemetria dei veicoli, consente di essere molto più accurata nel pricing delle polizze assicurative (che vuol dire premi più ridotti). Ed è un flusso di reddito che cresce all'aumentare dei veicoli Tesla venduti in maniera cumulata. Il prezzo rispetto agli utili del titolo azionario (metrica principale usata per valutare un investimento) oramai non è neanche così alto. NVIDIA, AMD e Amazon sono molto più care al momento per esempio.   >Prima di tutto, in quanto Europeo non mi inserirei nell' ""andremo"" di cui parli li sopra. A meno che tu non sia Americano, ""loro"" ci ""andranno"" su Marte in futuro. Noi Europei, chissà. Spero presto.  Ne beneficeremo comunque. E poi per me viene prima l'umanità, poi i confini.   > Non vedo il nesso con Musk. Cosa c'entra Musk con Marte a parte i suoi tweet stramboidi al riguardo? Se la Nasa volesse andare su Marte potrebbe farlo. Anche l'ESA potrebbe riuscirci  Il nesso con Musk è che con l'SLS della NASA, costato l'ira di Dio e tempi biblici, saremo in grado di fare una toccata e fuga (forse). Con la starship di Musk stabiliremo una colonia (che richiede la riutilizzabilità dei razzi). Mi preme sottolineare di nuovo il tuo modo di ragionare molto ottimista, per usare un eufemismo. Sbra come che potessimo fare un salto nella scala Kardashiev ma ci stiamo trattenendo per non si sa bene quale motivo. ""se volesse"", ""se avesse i soldi"". Con i se e con i ma non si fa nulla. Ed esistono dei vincoli.

Why?

Because the Reddit Admins have decided that [they want to kill off all 3rd-party apps](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), [3rd-party bots, and everything else that makes Reddit barely usable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/).

So you'll just have to put up with automod and a worse overall user experience in the meantime.

My guy you ever think this is why you don't have issues with Elon.... thanks for taking multiple posts to get to my point. Because conservatives don't have an issue with him because you all believe the exact same shit because you live in or operate in echo chambers..

Coming to Reddit doesn't change that specifically if you come with the thought process that you have some individuality that people who disagree with you don't.

I bet I could guess many other things you believe because you are nowhere near as individualistic as you think. You're being downvoted because people don't like what you say and that's what happens on Reddit

Dans certains pays d'Afrique (notamment Cameroun et Namibie), il y a peu de mines formelles au sens où on l'entend, des trucs qui ressembleraient à des carrières à ciel ouvert avec pelleteuses et marteaux-piqueurs quoi. A la place, il y a des gens qui parcourent la brousse à la recherche de filons plus-ou-moins à ciel ouvert.

Ces gars sont aidés, affrétés et parfois équipés par des mecs qui rachètent les pierres qu'ils trouvent, les empaquètent, les assurent et les revendent soit sur le marché sudaf', soit aux Pays-Bas pour De Beers ou les autres grands diamantaires. Ces gens se donnent des noms pompeux genre ""Bureau d'exploitation"", ""bureau de logistique"", ""centrale de diamanterie"", mais ce sont des mercenaires de la brousse comme tous les autres.

Et crois-moi, pour avoir bossé avec un mec qui gérait un ""bureau d'exploitation"" de diamants à Bangui, ils brassent des sommes surréalistes.

Une fois je me suis retrouvé à faire un blablacar avec un gamin d'une vingtaine d'années qui venait faire ses études en France (études de commerce). Il venait de Guinée Conakry et m'expliquait que sa famille était dans l'extraction du diamant et qu'on l'avait envoyé faire des études de commerce en Europe pour pouvoir faciliter la revente de ce genre de produits (et court-circuiter les intermédiaires). J'étais évidemment un peu dubitatif, mais là il commence à me montrer les photos que son frangin lui envoie sur Messenger (on était tous les deux passagers à l'arrière de la voiture). 

Et là, je vois des photos de cailloux gros comme des oeufs de caille. Il m'explique que le diamant de Guinée est peu réputé chez les joalliers et qu'il est surtout utilisé dans l'industrie mais qu'on trouve quand même parfois de belles pièces. Et il commence à me faire un cours sur les diamants. Du coup, je le questionne un peu et il m'explique qu'en gros l'extraction de diamant en Guinée c'est administrativement très simple mais logistiquement très compliqué. Sa famille est entièrement dans le business de l'extraction. Pour acheminer et entretenir les machines nécessaires à l'extraction, il y a des coûts gigantesques. Et il m'explique qu'en gros, des membres de sa famille prospectent en surface et quand ils trouvent un endroit potentiellement intéressant, ils mettent en branle toute la machinerie. 

Il m'expliquait qu'il y a plein d'arrangements avec les responsables locaux : si on veut pouvoir s'installer quelque part et creuser, il faut d'abord promettre l'embauche d'un certain nombre d'ouvriers locaux. Et avec ces ouvriers, il y a un intéressement pour ceux qui trouveraient les plus grosses pièces. Pour éviter la fauche de gros cailloux, les contremaitres proposent des primes en nature (carburant voire véhicules). 

Le mec m'expliquait aussi qu'ils n'allaient pas creuser très profond et que c'était plus intéressant de multiplier les zones d'extraction vu le matériel qu'ils avaient. 

En gros, les choses avaient l'air assez simple niveau légalité. 

Je n'ai aucun moyen de vérifier les dires du gamin. Mais vu les photos qu'il m'a montré et les détails qu'il donnait, ça avait l'air plutôt crédible.",morinl,9,0,2023-07-24 08:52:51,"Juste pour l'anecdote :
