I was so grateful to learn sign language as part of our curriculum In Primary school in Australia. We had quite a few deaf kids at school and it was awesome to be able to communicate. I definitely need a refresher as I know basic signs and the alphabet.,Queenside22,3782,0,2023-07-25 04:03:15

"This is so cool. It‚Äôs crazy to me that ASL isn‚Äôt taught as a mandatory language along with English in every school. Outside of the obvious reason of the hearing impaired being able to communicate with anyone, it has so many uses. In a crowded and loud room, sign. Have to be quiet for some reason, sign instead of whispering. Want to communicate with someone far away, sign. Accessibility makes life better for ALL people, not just the people with disabilities that need it. Also ASL is really easy to learn, most people are fluent after like 2 semesters of it and translators can get certified in 4-6 semesters. There is no reason not to have everyone learn it",Tinyturtle13,6,1,2023-07-25 12:07:18

It looks like the men who are criticising her are intimidated by powerful women and feel the need to bring her down a few notches. That's why they're attacking her looks (calling her a mid) her age (33, omg what a hag) and the movie which will no doubt make truck loads of money.

"I believe the hate comes from your average military standard-issue misogyny. So far, no critic (one with a negative opinion of the film Barbie) has brought up interesting, complex, or otherwise important commentary on the film. Very surface-level observations that they don't like for obvious reasons. This especially becomes obvious when a critic tries to defer their misogyny on ""bad pacing"". Before I went to college and studied film, I cared a lot about how I appeared to others based on what movies I liked. I realized this was silly and now I fall into the camp of moviegoers that doesn't care anymore about what the critics think. Critics are really just there to help film bros form their ""opinions"", and do not serve to represent the general public. They're way too toxic and ruin movies for me. Personally, I'm going to see Barbie with my Mom tomorrow and I'm quite excited!

"These aren't the entirety of manhood you're mostly encountering alt right losers and incels and emotionally disturbed bros who are always upset when women aren't submissive sex objects. It just blows their mind if they think a woman is ""hot"" and Robbie is conventionally attractive by Western white straight cis male standards. As a bisexual woman I could take her or leave her in that way, but to them she's a sex object first, human second or more like never. 

Promising Young Woman is one of the best recent films out there. It's hilarious to me that a bunch of mansplainers are shocked feminist mumblecore director Greta Gerwig did a satire of Barbie. Once again, they're clueless that a woman is a human being with like a fifteen year career.",Pale-Conversation320,1,0,2023-07-21 08:58:20
"Misogyny (and racism, homophobia, etc) really makes no sense. No matter what, the end goal is to hate on women, which is why the hate on Margot Robbie being ""too old"" is laughable. The goalposts are always being moved- we're too young or too old or too much makeup or not enough or too frumpy or too sexy or we shouldn't be outside the home but women who stay home are gold diggers etc etc etc. We're set up to never win and that's the end goal, they don't care if it makes sense or contradicts. 

Men can't stand if people who aren't white dudes exist in a movie, they can't stand if it's not about them. It has nothing to do with the movie or Margot Robbie or anything, just their pure hatred of anything deemed feminine. We've seen this before with Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, Star Wars characters like Rose, etc etc etc. They come out in droves to shit on women before they even know anything.

"Oh it sure is a commercial but sugarcoated in the libfem notion of ‚Äúfeminist empowerment‚Äù. 

You see Barbie ads everywhere in internet and in real life. Every single fast-fashion company produced a Barbie collection this year. And the pr campaign started like last year?? Every single day we read more insignificant news about Barbie on the biggest news portals like some made up ‚Äúscandals‚Äù like some companies ran out of pink paint or some other nonesense like that. Can you imagine how many companies sold enormous amounts of product, just for the commercial part tho? And I‚Äôm telling this as a feminist woman myself. This is a commercial. And Mattel is not only the antagonist of the movie, it is also one of the producers. It‚Äôs more like the commercial is the main product and the movie is just an excuse for all of it.

Capitalism will use everything, every notion in its own way, sometimes by degrading, sometimes by owning it. Feminism is (or must be) quite the opposite of capitalist society. But rather than making it the enemy visibly, system will look like it owns women‚Äôs rights in the form of ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù, sell whatever it can out of it and will degrade the rest as ‚Äúwokism‚Äù, ‚Äúradicalism‚Äù, ‚Äúcrazyness‚Äù etc. By this way, no threat to the state or upper classes will be made but some people will get even richer.

Margot has the acting chops but shes just so damn hot that I look at her and just see Margot instead of whatever role she's playing. Plus it seems like Margot is in everything these days.

Also depends on the age range, if mid to late 30s is the range, I like Lea Seydoux though I can't say I've heard her do an American accent. Nathalie Emmanuel as a blonde might be interesting and they could kind of repeat F4s race swap of Johnny Storm and it wouldn't have to be explained by adoption.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to run defense for someone who is probably a sex trafficker, and definitely a disgusting human being, but I just grew up around so many people who were always talking about how wrong it was to shame people for their body size, facial features, and overall looks, but then Paris Hilton would do something stupid and they would immediately rush to how she's actually not attractive, and it was like.... bro, say what you want, but everyone I knew who said that would have chewed off all the fingers on their left hand to have a one nighter with her.

&#x200B;

Edit - I should clarify that I don't care if people rip on Tate for his appearance if it is a response to his statements on appearance. It's fair game to make fun of his chin if he's going to be ragging on women for whatever features he doesn't like.

"That was very clever of her. In hindsight, looking back at a movie like Captain Marvel you can make an argument that there is a scope for big IP, female centered movies with feminist message that the internet is going to talk about endlessly whether good or bad. Here atleast talk around Barbie is more positive.

I know Captain marvel partly owed its success to being in the middle of two Avengers movies but considering the discourse that happened during that movie, people who went to see it just to support it, people who went to see it to hate on it. There is a target audience to serve for movies like these and get people engaged online whether good or bad way.

Margot tried this female empowerment movie with Birds of Prey (She was a producer there as well) but due to the pandemic and knowing it was Rated-R which was a stupid decision considering it could use that younger female crowd it didn't do super well.

"My gut instinct while watching the movie was gosling is the lone acting nominee. I just felt like Robbie was missing that one thing to push her over the edge, maybe you said it best with her being the ‚Äústraight man‚Äù for the more silly roles at times. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because gosling was so fucking good and outshone everyone that compared to him it wasn‚Äôt as showy/obvious performance. 

She was still great and could see her getting a nom, especially if there‚Äôs a lot of films moving to next year. 

It‚Äôs worth saying that she is also a producer on the movie and I assume will get a nomination if it‚Äôs nominated for picture. She‚Äôs actually such an incredible producer. From her breakout in wolf of Wall Street 10 years ago to get to the position she is now where she is a bonafide A lister star who has sway to be able to produce high quality films like this is quite remarkable.

"Even if movies aren't delayed, Barbie will be the most nominated WB movie and be win-competitive in just about everything it's in.

"I would agree but I really think Barbie‚Äôs chances are being way overestimated. It‚Äôs essentially the Top Gun: Maverick of the year whilst being more competitive in Screenplay and having a buzzed about supporting performance that will *probably* get nominated. 

I don‚Äôt at all understand why people think the Director‚Äôs branch who thought Dune was too commercial will suddenly go for a movie about a toy and, let‚Äôs be honest, one created mainly to sell more toys. Nor do I understand why people think Gosling will be in any way win competitive when he‚Äôs 100% a purely comedic performance the likes of which are rarely even nominated (before anyone brings her up, JLC in EEAAO had more emotional moments and had one of the most aggressive campaigns this side of Roma in addition to a much stronger narrative than Gosling).

With all that said, yes, I would agree that Robbie would definitely come along for the ride in case of Barbie doing really well and especially if Gerwig gets into Director. She‚Äôs the main character and shows a lot of range in the movie, including her emotional moment near the end that apparently made people cry. And if the strike continues into the winter, I could see Barbie benefit because it already has a lot of visibility.

I do think there's been an element with Gosling's praise that is sort of ""hey get a load of this guy taking his work in a girl movie seriously"" - not that he's bad by any means but playing ""against"" type helps a performance gain notoriety. 

Margot Robbie's been an interesting actor for me because it really feels like she's so stereotypical as a Hollywood bombshell that it has been hard to escape that perception. It is ironic that some of her best roles in Harley Quinn and now Barbie has really been about not only engaging with a bimbo stereotype but embracing it. 

What she's doing in Barbie is so technical and precise and she makes it seem effortless. She could probably do 80% of what she's doing without dialogue. I think Bombshell as dunked on that movie is has a really great Robbie performance as well.

"This guy is way beyond idiotic. Hollywood has become a place where mostly everyone (especially women) are made to look stunning at all times, even when they‚Äôre doing nothing and look like any average person on the street, they still look like they are just extremely attractive people. They are expected to keep up those appearances, even with a natural look. So naturally, society thinks this is what beautiful and attractiveness is. But they forget that it is all smoke and mirrors. There is nothing natural about the ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù Hollywood portrays. Most of the beauty is fake. Even though underneath it is beauty all on its own. What this guy deems ‚Äúmid‚Äù, is what beauty really is. He has been made a fool of, and announced it to the world.

"Well, as far as I know, there are some actresses that are actually disliked by a good enough number of people (like Amber Heard). She is definitely not one of those - I think she is liked well enough. 

I don't think people will see a movie because she stars in it, but it does prove she can absolutely lead a film and enhance it, even if she is not THE reason people go see it.

I think it also proves the movies she was in actually were bad, their lack of success had nothing to do with her performance - she is perfectly fine with the right direction in the right movie.

And in my opinion, it also proves how misguided Hollywood is putting politics in movies. They put the wrong politics in the wrong movies. 

As in, they keep trying to put feminism in movies for a male audience - which is dumb: they only marginally attract more women, but they alienate a large part of the men who would've payed for it.

On the other hand, she literally IS Barbie, is the one who did the insane promotional tour that got a ton of positive press, and her performance helped the movie get such amazing reviews. 

So‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs neither and both. She is undoubtedly a box office star. But she‚Äôs also undoubtedly not someone who can draw crowds to movies based solely off her name alone. But nowadays, there are very few who can do that.

If we are believe that asshole that Margot is mid and you're any of the other 4 billion woman, most of whom are not on Margot's level, then by that logic you're less than mid.

It was a WMD Neg and always was. Engaging in further distinction is just buying in to the original lie",GruxKing,81,0,2023-07-23 18:46:34

"Yeah that could be it for sure. I also think these things are incredibly subjective in general and also cultural sometimes. My boyfriend is from Moldova and I've noticed that he has a wayyy different idea of beauty than the average American.

"Margot Robbie is definitely not mid, but the reason men don't find her as attractive as they ""should"" is because she doesn't have hips.

The hottest Margot Robbie has ever been is the Wolf of Wall Street scene, not because she's naked, but because she turns to the side and pushes her leg out so it looks like she has them.",ScoldOnTheCob,22,0,2023-07-23 18:55:20

As are the casts of TSS, Peacemaker, Blue Beetle, Shazam and Aquaman. Any actors that ONLY appeared in DCEU movies that Safran and Gunn had nothing to do with making are almost all on the chopping block.

"A little bit of fame worship doesn't seem bad. It probably even feels good. But it's really not okay.
Too long to explain the psychology, sociology, equality issues. Hopefully if i just say ""there are better people than this fampus person in QLD, who contribute more to the world"" i hope that is enough for you to reconsider prioritising famous people as somehow good, just for their fame.",ComplainyGuy,-12,0,2023-07-22 05:28:31

"I still rue the day all those decades ago that women stole the manly pink colour and made it their own.

I do not go for girly stuff, but I like the colour pink.

And I just assumed Margot Robbie was a US actress.  I do not follow films/TV/music.",bruised-teste,-10,0,2023-07-22 08:29:42

"James Gunn has said numerous times he wants to continue working with her. So I‚Äôm thinking if Robbie isn‚Äôt sick of playing Harley yet Gunn will keep her around. My guess is that if she does stick around, Greta Gerwig could do a potential Gotham City Sirens movie since apparently her and Robbie loved working together",batmanfan_91,13,0,2023-07-26 23:08:16
