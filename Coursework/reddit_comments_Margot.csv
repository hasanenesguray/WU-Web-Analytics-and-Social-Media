For the most part I like Andrew’s styling but it also kinda depends on the client (some of his other clients are Zoe Kravitz, Kaia Gerber, Lily Rose Depp, Billie Eilish and Hailey Bieber) but he has been doing an incredible job for this press tour - though so much credit goes to Margot for being able to pull off anything!

"This is so cool. It’s crazy to me that ASL isn’t taught as a mandatory language along with English in every school. Outside of the obvious reason of the hearing impaired being able to communicate with anyone, it has so many uses. In a crowded and loud room, sign. Have to be quiet for some reason, sign instead of whispering. Want to communicate with someone far away, sign. Accessibility makes life better for ALL people, not just the people with disabilities that need it. Also ASL is really easy to learn, most people are fluent after like 2 semesters of it and translators can get certified in 4-6 semesters. There is no reason not to have everyone learn it",Tinyturtle13,6,1,2023-07-25 12:07:18

I wasn’t a hard-core Barbie fan as a kid, I had a few, like most little girls. But really, I should give Barbie a whole lot more credit. She knew exactly who I was before it truly dawned on me later in life. In a “funny because it’s totally true (and how the fuck did I not see this?)“ way…when I built my little Barbie houses from boxes and scarves and such…my Barbie lived alone. She always had a chess board as a dance floor in her party room, and when she got home from her Jetset Business Barbie travels, she’d throw parties and have all her friends over…you know, the whole Strawberry Shortcake gang, some Smurfs, etc. The key thing was that *Ken never lived there*. He came over for her parties or a date night sleepover and then *went the fuck home*. They weren’t going to get married or have a little baby Barbies, things were the way they were going to be forever and her house would always be just her. That’s how she liked it.

"I posted about this recently

Men have been the same from the time I was little

It doesn’t matter how perfect or flawless the woman is. They will make a point to underrate her

Men see women as narcissists basking in male attention all the time. They like to sow insecurity

Eta cuz I was multitasking

Same reason they make a big show of talking down models or other celebrities when they weigh 500 lbs and stink. It’s a coping mechanism. He would never have a shot with that woman anyway so he can look like he’s totally not like the other simps by “rejecting” her first

Some will also do something similar where they casually mention how they just “Don’t really find models/celebs that attractive” or” so n so is too skinny” not necessarily because it’s true (and sometimes it is) but because they’re hoping to appeal to the insecurities of women within earshot “oh he might appreciate my belly” you get the idea

The root is. They’re insecure. They can’t have her or anyone near her league. So sour grapes. You’ve seen I’m sure how many women are afraid to be openly honest that they find themselves attractive because there’s an army of insecure men and women lining up to tell them they’re ugly just because they hate seeing pretty people be aware of their prettiness and also again, because they want to drop people’s egos",[deleted],89,0,2023-07-20 18:45:22

"We should probably separate two things here, because I don't think it's problematic for a guy to not enjoy the Barbie movie, or to criticize it -- Manohla Dargis for the NY Times seemed a little lukewarm on it, for example.  Even if you think this is Citizen Kane meets Casablanca meets Clueless, there is room for legitimate disagreement.  And that disagreement is ok, moreover, even if you think that someone else's view is not well-founded -- if you think that people who didn't enjoy it don't have a good reason for not enjoying it.  So to the extent that OP is arguing that it's not ok for people to not like this movie... it's ok for people to not like things you like.

But, of course there is always that group out there who hate various women for exceedingly silly reasons -- and for sure there are some of them commenting on the movie.  So when you get stuff like ""she's too old"" or ""she's not pretty enough,"" then that's obviously just nonsense -- those aren't reasons to not like the movie, they're reasons to hate on an actress for existing and that's quite obviously different.  So, I think we need to keep those two separate.",SafetyDanceInMyPants,3,0,2023-07-20 21:36:52

Having thought about it a bit since, for me its her association with WB and DC during the lowest points of the feanchise. I disliked amy adams, henry cavil, and michael shanon for a long time after MoS too, though I love all three now.

"There will always be a bad review. Someone will try and make their mark by knocking what other people love and some people will have a relatively honest and kneejerk reaction to what is effectively a giant corporation's ad for their toy and it won't be about Margot specifically. The review complaining about it being a commercial is probably valid. Reviews complain about that all the time when a toy company makes a movie as there is a feeling it detracts from the ""art of cinema"" with impure commercial motives. Some online people might have something against her for dumb reasons like past roles. It's the internet, you can find 10 people saying the weirdest shit you ever thought possible. I haven't seen it though. This movie is getting a TON of praise and I haven't even seen any Twitter rando's complaining about her although I'm absolutely sure they exist.

"I believe the hate comes from your average military standard-issue misogyny. So far, no critic (one with a negative opinion of the film Barbie) has brought up interesting, complex, or otherwise important commentary on the film. Very surface-level observations that they don't like for obvious reasons. This especially becomes obvious when a critic tries to defer their misogyny on ""bad pacing"". Before I went to college and studied film, I cared a lot about how I appeared to others based on what movies I liked. I realized this was silly and now I fall into the camp of moviegoers that doesn't care anymore about what the critics think. Critics are really just there to help film bros form their ""opinions"", and do not serve to represent the general public. They're way too toxic and ruin movies for me.

As a bisexual woman I could take her or leave her in that way, but to them she's a sex object first, human second or more like never. 

Promising Young Woman is one of the best recent films out there. It's hilarious to me that a bunch of mansplainers are shocked feminist mumblecore director Greta Gerwig did a satire of Barbie.

"Misogyny (and racism, homophobia, etc) really makes no sense. No matter what, the end goal is to hate on women, which is why the hate on Margot Robbie being ""too old"" is laughable. The goalposts are always being moved- we're too young or too old or too much makeup or not enough or too frumpy or too sexy or we shouldn't be outside the home but women who stay home are gold diggers etc etc etc. We're set up to never win and that's the end goal, they don't care if it makes sense or contradicts. 

Men can't stand if people who aren't white dudes exist in a movie, they can't stand if it's not about them. It has nothing to do with the movie or Margot Robbie or anything, just their pure hatred of anything deemed feminine. We've seen this before with Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, Star Wars characters like Rose, etc etc etc. They come out in droves to shit on women before they even know anything.

"Oh it sure is a commercial but sugarcoated in the libfem notion of “feminist empowerment”. 

You see Barbie ads everywhere in internet and in real life. Every single fast-fashion company produced a Barbie collection this year. And the pr campaign started like last year?? Every single day we read more insignificant news about Barbie on the biggest news portals like some made up “scandals” like some companies ran out of pink paint or some other nonesense like that. Can you imagine how many companies sold enormous amounts of product, just for the commercial part tho? And I’m telling this as a feminist woman myself. This is a commercial. And Mattel is not only the antagonist of the movie, it is also one of the producers. It’s more like the commercial is the main product and the movie is just an excuse for all of it.

Capitalism will use everything, every notion in its own way, sometimes by degrading, sometimes by owning it. Feminism is (or must be) quite the opposite of capitalist society. But rather than making it the enemy visibly, system will look like it owns women’s rights in the form of “empowerment”, sell whatever it can out of it and will degrade the rest as “wokism”, “radicalism”, “crazyness” etc. By this way, no threat to the state or upper classes will be made but some people will get even richer. 

Men will find every sort of excuses to degrade women’s successes, or actually everything a women might have. This on the other hand is not one of those excuses I believe.",notoriginal-miska,0,0,2023-07-21 12:26:13

Anyway - if you asked this yesterday, I would have said slide 4 (the black dress with the flaired skirt -- very marilyn monroe).  Today it's Slide 3 (Barbie Enchanted I think -- pink dress with fur collar and long white gloves) --- reminded me of the ultimate princess/movie-star Grace Kelly.

I genuinely think a lot of these people live their lives entirely online, because there's no way people are this out of touch that Margot Robbie looks old if they actually interact with other humans.

Anyone that thinks she looks ""old"" is going to struggle HARD with aging, because I guarantee they don't look anything like this even at whatever age they are now.

There's also a disturbing trend of putting filters on Margot, Angelina, and what most people would consider upper echelon attractive celebrities to give them that generic Instagram face.

"I think Margot is stunning. She is head to toe classical golden Hollywood era beautiful. She’s so photogenic. I don’t think anyone can argue that she’s not stunning if they someone does try to argue it then they’re probably jealous.   
  
She does have sun damage just like everyone else in Australia (I’m Australian btw). She’s wearing makeup in all of the pictures but you can still see a lot of her sun spots like underneath her eyes and there’s some prominent ones on the side of her forehead. They’re kind of blurred but definitely visible in the picture from Instagram you have there. The picture from the MET Gala shows them very clearly especially on her forehead. These types of spots you normally see on people who are older like closer to retirement but they’re common on people in Australia even in their early twenties and thirties. And yeah, her skin is crinklier for her age especially around her eyes and mouth which is from sun damage. ***But, does it make her less beautiful? I say no.***   
  
I don’t know why people pit it against her that she has sun damage or say her bone structure makes her look too mature. It’s not like she got to choose where she was born or her body. She’s still freaking gorgeous. There’s no procedure to my knowledge that can give anyone her big, bright, wide set seaglass eyes and her big smile.  
  
It’s true that Australians look older for their age compared to people in other parts of the world of the same age. The environment is so harsh and you’re still exposed to it on a daily basis if you’re trying to live your life because not even using sunscreen and shade is enough. I did my studies in Boston, USA and did summer road trips with friends through many states. Not that I was intentionally judging anyone but I couldn’t help notice during my first years there how many of my peers, who were mostly American students from all over the country and international students from China and India, looked much younger skin wise than my peers in Australia. Much less spotty  and crinkly around the eyes and more even skintone and just skin that looked firmer and thicker. 

But there are lot of things that can fix that type of stuff especially if you save some money and set aside time. Jealous and bad personalities are harder to fix if they can be fixed at all. I have never seen one of those people who say Margot is bad looking to ever volunteer to post their own pictures. They’re probably the same type of people who need to fish for compliments on social media.  


I don't equate numerical age for beauty and I don't think having bad skin or sun damage and stuff like that is a criteria for beauty. You can be beautiful with amazing personality but bad skin. You can have the most objectively beautiful skin but ugly with a bad personality that just makes someone even uglier.",northernbeautybelle,207,0,2023-07-28 17:11:49

"She looks 33. I’m 33. This is how I look. (Well, not a smoke show like her, but the same skin texture and small wrinkles)

The problem is, fillers, Botox, skin peels, etc. are all we see on female celebrities in media and on red carpets. So when a woman who hasn’t had work done is shown, we can’t correlate a normally aged 33 year old woman to the ones who have had plastic surgery or enhancements. 

Our culture has perpetuated a lie that woman over 30 are old. And that unless we strive to look 20, we have no value. It’s simply not true. She looks great. She looks her age. 

Note: This isn’t a dig at people who get fillers and Botox or other procedures. I’m all for doing whatever makes you feel best and I know in the future I’ll be ready to take that route too.

She’s fucking hot. She’s 33 not 25. She looks 33. Yes you may have some wrinkles when you’re 33. You may not. But she’s also light skin and more prone to sun damage and premature aging.

It seems like we've been seeing her in movies for a long time so I just thought she was older than 33.

Edit to add: Vanessa Hudgens is 1 year older than her. Zac Efron is 2 years older. Ashley Tisdale is 5 years older. Weird to think these Disney Stars are older!

"She looks like she is in her 30s and her amazing skin is showing the signs of someone who has been alive for 30 years. Human bodies just kinda accumulate years and there’s no way it doesn’t show in small or big ways.

Unpopular take maybe but when I see posts on this sub talking about ‘do I look old’, it’s honestly rarely a skin issue. A lot of it is fat loss from, well, getting older. 

I’m a guy and I get a lot of comments about looking older than my age. I just know it’s honestly my facial structure combined with fat loss in my early 30s.

I swear, over 25, and especially over 30, you don’t look as young as you think you are. I don’t mean that in a mean way. We just age - no amount if tret, acids, or sunscreen is gonna change that. But hey, at least you can have healthy skin at any age!",meteoricbunny,2,0,2023-07-28 20:07:44

"The part of the article we should actually be paying attention to:

“They continue to tell men, ‘You have be powerful, violent and in control of your woman - that’s the only way for a man to be successful’. They really double down on exactly the kind of messaging that is harming men in the first place. And if we could provide boys with offline spaces to explore some of the anxieties, fears and frustrations that often send them into the arms of these communities, then that would be a really good way to offset their power. 
It can’t be a coincidence that these communities have risen so sharply in their influence and success at grooming young people at the same time that we’ve seen a massive decline in funding for youth services. Hundreds of youth centres have been forced to shut their doors and boys don’t have that same opportunity offline to create a sense of community, purpose, belonging and brotherhood. That’s what these communities are offering them.”

It has nothing to do with Margot Robbie or the Barbie movie. I don’t know if it was a decision from above or what, but I wish the publication hadn’t used the celebrity example to garner the article attention.

Margot has the acting chops but shes just so damn hot that I look at her and just see Margot instead of whatever role she's playing. Plus it seems like Margot is in everything these days.

Also depends on the age range, if mid to late 30s is the range, I like Lea Seydoux though I can't say I've heard her do an American accent. Nathalie Emmanuel as a blonde might be interesting and they could kind of repeat F4s race swap of Johnny Storm and it wouldn't have to be explained by adoption.

"Just saw it.

Greatest movie I’ve ever seen. 

Gerwig has unseated Kubrick, Kurosawa, and Tarkovsky as the greatest filmmaker of all-time.

She has not only single handedly destroyed the patriarchy, crony capitalism, and the wrongheaded idea that women can’t do everything better than men: she has dared to go where no one has ever gone before: to a toy for inspiration. Never been done. Probably never will be done again.

Brilliant.

It truly took a woman to be the greatest filmmaker of all/time. No man could ever be as subtle, brilliant, and multi-faceted. Its only flaw is that everything else sucks in comparison now.

Seriously: she reframed the creation myth, raised up the Shekinah, queered the heiros gamos, and officially unseated the Demiurge.

"People in this thread are writing that she was so poor and is a hero for this, but first, that is a basic what you can do for your mother when you are a millionaire, and second research the facts about her. Margot was not rich and her father walked out on them but she wasn't like extremely poor either.  She had a home, food on the table - no problem, dancing lessons, and her extended family owns a large farm in Australia where she spent her time - this is literally the official info on her IMDB page. So... you can miss me with sky-high praises for her. 

The truth is she still had/has a lot of privileges. She is white, beautiful, has a classic type of beauty, and she comes from an English-speaking country - all of these elements are advantages in Hollywood if you know this town and the movie business. The aspiring actresses who are black/ of color and those who come to Hollywood with the dream from non-English speaking countries, especially Slavs, have it WAY harder. 

In fact, if you came from Eastern Europe especially, you have it very hard because the language is a fundament in the movie/acting business, and except for the typical cliche 'Russian spy' trope, there isn't much for them in Hollywood. 

For every other role, they have to compete with native English speakers from around not just the US, but Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zeland, etc., and still the Latinas are chosen before Slavic girls (I have seen it, actually, I have a connection to this industry through my friends). The Hispanic and Latino community became quite strong in Hollywood in the last decades and altho they still also face hardships in the business, thanks to the US connection and closeness to South and Central America, and quite a big movie/tv business in South America, they have it easier than Eastern Europeans. I find it especially ironic because Hollywood was founded mostly by a few Polish Jews (fun fact: all of them were born very close to Warsaw) who came to the US before WWI.",Maximum-Status-7420,1,0,2023-07-27 13:23:44

Communicating is pushing it…but good on her for knowing the alphabet a bit,kalemeh8,1,0,2023-07-26 13:52:14
"Good on her. But to be fair, knowing the alphabet and knowing sign language are vastly different things. I know many people learn the alphabet as a novelty so this headline is a stretch making it sound like she fully knows sign language",Batmankoff,0,0,2023-07-26 01:57:22
"That's the alphabet. Learned Auslan back in my late teens, and the alphabet is all I remember now.",Far_Peanut_3038,0,0,2023-07-26 12:14:31
The alphabet is the easiest to learn. And it’s not like she’s actually communicating with this guy.,cleverunderground,-9,0,2023-07-26 01:52:55
