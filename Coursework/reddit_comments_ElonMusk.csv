"This is evident with the differences between him and Zuckerburg's poo watching policies

Elon Musk saw this in one of the slack channels

https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/031/634/guy-fired-over-meme-job-work-post-facebook-cody-hidalgo-fb.png

And he replied to it with a giant wall of text basically saying that he's 44 billion dollars in debt, made a bunch of sacrifices, and the employees are the ones making money.

But that's not all.

Elon Musk now has been going into bathrooms now and if he see's someone sitting in on the stalls, he pops his head over to talk to them about their projects in order to make sure they aren't pooping longer than necessary and stealing company time.

The meme seems to really gotten under his skin.

after Elon started doing it he bragged to mark zuckerburg about it, but then mark sent him this meme

https://i.imgflip.com/77us2q.jpg context


In the early days of facebook Mark Zuckerburg would wander into the company bathrooms and if he noticed someone sitting down in the stalls he would pop his head over and try to talk to them about their projects. Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out.

Everyone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated.

That all stopped when Michael Moritz, legendary silicon valley investor, and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders, was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding. He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that's when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how's the diligence coming along.

Michael Moritz, not one to mince words, was apoplectic. 'GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER.' Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted, because he really loved intimate poop conversations 'Aw c'mon Michael, it's silicon valley'. Zuckerburg then withdrew after Moritz flung his cellphone into his eye socket. 

30 minutes later, Mark was in a very import meeting (where he banned questions about his black eye) when Moritz walked into the conference room. 'Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg, OUT'. As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg, at the time Moritz was the bigger deal, and they all scurried out of the room.

Zuckerburg, however, is not one to be intimated by anyone. Not the Winkewoz twins, not Eduardo Savarn, not Peter Thiel, and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz. Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice, but Michael Moritz was having none of that. Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR nightmare, and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued, which would have been a catastrophe for the company.

Zuckerburg pretended to arbitrate 'Ok fine, but you need to give me a good reason, because if it were normal, there would be no problem'.

Moritz was flabberghasted at this response. Was this a serious question? He answered with the most obvious answer 'Because.... it's not FUCKING NORMAL'.

Unknown to Moritz, Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall, and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands. Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage, but Zuckerburg was a master strategist.

Zuckerburg went for the pounce. 'Okay, I'll lets write out an agreement, in writing I'll rescind the policy because it's not normal'. Moritz was dumbfounded, but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders, afterall he was also an early investor in Apple, and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs. Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence.

When Moritz left, a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg's face. "" 'Not Normal' eh? "" Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh. Ever since then, Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life-long crusade to normalize poop conversations.

He had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this. His advisors would tell him it's impossible, but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list. From normalizing smart phone use on the toilet (actually a collaboration between Mark Zuckerburg and Steve Jobs), to trusting Mark with their private photos, to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy.

In 2015, Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall, having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap. That's when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus, and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality. If he could coax people into having life-like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality, then doing it in the real world wouldn't be too big of a leap.

Do you read facebook or instagram while you're pooping? Ever consider what urges you to do that? It's not your personal preference, it's by Mark Zuckerburg's design.

Zuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized.

Mark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop.

Are you going to let him?

EDIT, UPDATE

I just got this in my DM. 

>I am a ex Facebook worker. Everything you said rings true. I speak to you at the risk of consequences for breaking my NDA. When I was at Facebook I was involved in a program called Project PooPal. Mark Zuckerburg was planning on Meta entering the exploding tele-therapy space, but targeting people who are not ready to talk to an actual person. You talk to a virtual reality therapist who responds with what is described as the greatest AI (though whatever you tell it, it only responds with 'wow, tell me more'). The thing is, the virtual reality assistant has a striking resemblance to Mark Zuckerburg himself. But the most damning aspect is that it's supposed to used only when you're pooping. This feature is described as optional, though uses the most advanced AI for your phone camera to check if you're actually on a toilet, and if not, says 'It looks like you're not pooping. Please start pooping and try again'. I always wondered what is the purpose and origin of the project. Now I know.",BadBoysWillBeSpanked,1,0,2023-07-28 16:20:38
"I have been warning about this for 2 years. Hopefully now that someone famous brings attention to it, science will stop being suspended and the necessary research (that was largely deliberately avoided thus far) will finally start being completed.

Of course when I posted this in mainstream subs it was censored by those who claim to be progressive and pro-freedom of speech:

It is hypothesized by experts that it is the spike protein of this virus that is associated with health issues. Keep in mind that China has around 40 000 wet markets, the virus popped up in the only wet market in the only city with the only virology institute in the country that was doing coronavirus research. Keep in mind that the Challenger, Chernobyl, Ohio train spill, and 1000s of other factual historical events show that humans are generally bad at maintaining safety standards 100% of the time and that doing risky activities/research is a matter of when, not if, things will accidentally go wrong. Keep in mind that there was a ban on the type of research done at Wuhan, but in late 2017 the ban expired and was not continued. A couple years later the pandemic happened.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(18)30006-9/fulltext

https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-lifts-3-year-ban-funding-risky-virus-studies

Keep in mind that the accidental lab leak hypothesis was 100% rejected/ignored (up to recently: now, many of the world's experts in this field appear to be open to it), and the vaccine was immediately based on the novel spike protein of this novel virus that there is no evidence of where it comes from (keep in mind the original SARS virus, in a few weeks the animal host was immediately identified), while no other virus in the past had a spike protein that independently was associated with issues. Keep in mind that vaccine injuries from the covid vaccines are rare, though the few people who do have vaccine injuries appear to have the same symptoms as those with long covid from the virus. 

Also, according to government of Western Australia data, the covid vaccines have a 24 times higher risk of adverse effects compared to other vaccines.

https://www.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Corp/Documents/Health-for/Immunisation/Western-Australia-Vaccine-Safety-Surveillance-Annual-Report-2021.pdf

From page 2:

>In WA, the total AEFI rate following a COVID-19 vaccine was 264.1 per 100,000 doses.
...
There were 1,808,050 individual doses of non-COVID-19 vaccines recorded in the AIR in 2021, giving a total AEFI rate of 11.1 events per 100,000 doses, which is similar to the reported 2020 rate of 12.4 per 100,000 doses.

Check page 33 to see breakdown by symptoms. For example, it shows of all people in that time period who had a non covid vaccine, a total of 1 person reported chest pain, compared to 1404 reports of chest pain in those with a covid vaccine. 1 vs 98 respectively for myocarditis. Logically, statistically, rationally, can this be a coincidence? Keep in mind there was no significant difference in terms of rate of adverse effects between type of covid vaccine technology (i.e., mRNA vs ""traditional""): all the covid vaccines more or less had the same astronomically higher (around 24 times) rate of adverse effects than other vaccines. So logically, how can it be the vaccine technology/the actual vaccine itself causing this higher rate. To me, using basic logic, I would assume the content of the vaccine would warrant a closer look. All of the covid vaccines either directly or indirectly result in the production of the novel spike protein of this novel virus in the human body.

See the following articles, the first presented to the American Heart Association, the other done by researchers at Harvard Medical School:

https://newsroom.heart.org/news/coronavirus-spike-protein-activated-natural-immune-response-damaged-heart-muscle-cells

>“Our study provides two pieces of evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike  protein does not need ACE2 to injure the heart. First, we found that the  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injured the heart of lab mice. Different from  ACE2 in humans, ACE2 in mice does not interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike  protein, therefore, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not injure the heart by  directly disrupting ACE2 function. Second, although both the SARS-CoV-2  and NL63 coronaviruses use ACE2 as a receptor to infect cells, only the  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacted with TLR4 and inflamed the heart  muscle cells. Therefore, our study presents a novel, ACE2-independent  pathological role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, ” Lin said.

https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061025

>Conclusions:
Immunoprofiling  of vaccinated adolescents and young adults revealed that the mRNA  vaccine–induced immune responses did not differ between individuals who  developed myocarditis and individuals who did not. However, free spike  antigen was detected in the blood of adolescents and young adults who  developed post-mRNA vaccine myocarditis, advancing insight into its  potential underlying cause.

Here is more research showing that the novel spike protein from this novel virus, unlike the spike protein of any other virus, independently is associated with damage:

"Tesla / Space X:

* All the sexual assault, harassment and racism claims are getting investigated and perpetrators fired.
* Review all wages company-wide for sex and racial bias, boosting underpaid employees.
* Ensure consistent generous employee benefits with healthcare, vacation and child leave. My companies should be the best place to work.
* Halt Tesla and SpaceX production for a week to meet and exceed all safety regulations. (eg: rumor is that musk ordered safety markings removed around some of the robots because he didn't like the color.)
* Implement continuous improvement quality management at Tesla and SpaceX, this means any assembly line employee can halt production when something goes wrong and that process will be fixed so it won't happen again.
* Reduce the number of car models and start a design refresh so the exterior doesn't look like a pill and interior doesn't look like a Swedish prison.
* Cancel the Cybertruck and redirect resources to study public transit that can work with Boring Company tunnels. The end goal is to make tunnels and fill them with self-driving Tesla Trains.
* Expand and refresh Tesla service centers to provide best-in-class customer service. This will lose money at first, but as car quality improves this will get easier.
* Work with allied military to ensure that active Ukrainian soldiers no longer have to pay for Starlink service out of their own pocket, there's now a service tier for allies in a war zone. This will either be free or paid subsidized by the US government as part of the overall SpaceX relationship. 

Twitter:

* Immediately ban all Nazis and right-wing trolls from Twitter. Trump is gone, as is every grifting right-winger.
* It's Twitter again, not X.
* Slowly reverse all bone-headed decisions since taking over the company.
* End the crunch, restore benefits, rebuild staffing.
* Rebuild trust with Twitter advertisers.

Society:

* Announce the formation and funding of a social / thinktank foundation to study and support social issues, the homeless crisis, global hunger and global warming. The foundation will attempt to find the best solutions to solve these problems and then fund them.
* Invite celebrities and politicians that are qualified to become ambassadors for the foundation, helping the reagh global goals.
* Bully other billionaires to help out with this also.

Family:

* Publicly apologize for my previous caustic views and attempt to make amends with my estranged children. All my kids are getting a modest trust fund or inheritance regardless of their attitudes towards me.",Chroko,2,0,2023-07-28 07:43:22
"I firmly believe there is no endgame. This whole debacle is the epitome of:

“It’s so dumb it’s brilliant! 
“No! It’s just dumb!” 

Musk has no experience in running a business of this nature. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX. They’re not REALLY public facing businesses in the same way Twitter is. Musk is, at his core, a software engineer, or a engineer generally if I am being generous. Twitter has massive exposure to engineering issues obviously, but it’s offering isn’t one you can improve through solving engineering issues. It hasn’t REALLY changed what it does for years, which is basically let people put text on the internet. That’s it. You are never going to revolutionise the core of that, nor should you want to, because if you do you’re losing the point of the platform in the first place. 

That’s why Twitter isn’t about engineering. It’s not about creating something people want to buy or use. Twitter is about people, it’s about communication, it’s about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. This isn’t something he can build. It’s something he has to understand. And he doesn’t understand it. 

He is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. All the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what HE wants and that he is so convinced of his own rightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

On some level, the idea of “X” as a one-stop shop app to do everything isn’t, necessarily, a terrible one. But it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbents which he will have to compete with. 

It’s going to be VERY hard to make those inroads but it isn’t necessarily impossible. However, the way to approach that challenge is NOT by turning off millions of people by taking edgy views on social issues. I for one will never use X in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain Musk is and I’m sure I’m not alone. 

The things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. I’m not saying he’s a bad businessman. He is incredibly successful and wealthy. Sure that could be down to luck, but I doubt all of it is. He has a set of skills. But they’re not relevant for Twitter and everything he’s done so far shouldn’t fill anyone with confidence. Getting into a business and immediately alienating a sizeable proportion of its user base is, by any metric, a dumb move.",Joec1211,10,0,2023-07-24 20:30:07
"Unfortunately unpopular opinion:

Elon musk has done great work in changing the world to be more sustainable. Remember the 3 R's? Reduce, reuse, recycle.

Tesla helps reduce carbon emissions.

SpaceX refuses rockets, reducing the footprint of the space industry.

Solar city recycles excess electricity generated from your roof back into the power grid. You can get paid for this.

I wholeheartly think that all the Elon hate is wildy undeserved and largely manufactured by those who run the industries he has disrupted in his quest for sustainability. He is one of the very few people actually making meaningful change in what people have bitching about for decades ie doing something about climate change.

Biden hosted an EV summit and didn't invite Tesla, which is the EV company 90% responsible for the growing EV market around the world. Previous to them no car company took EVs seriously since they couldn't generate consumer sentiment like Tesla could. Thats ridiculous, right? Like even objectively ridiculous no matter what view you have on Elon I'd argue.

And now he is revolutionizing social media with his leaps and bounds he is making in the way he is running X (previously Twitter). When internet and social media was small, it was easily justifiable to ban people for any cause, I mean what difference did it make then? Not very much. But now with the evolution of social media, thought structures and what gets shared has real impact on the real world. Social and political movements are created and perpetuated primarily on social media. The president of the United States and other countries address the public through posts now, not just the television. People in power were paying social media companies to silence those who challenge their narrative and this is not ethically correct now that social media has become a main artery in sharing news, and forming opinion. Many think he is ""ruining Twitter"" but they will thank him in the future for the precedent he is setting ie not only taking a strong stance on shadow banning people without informing as to why, but also in profit sharing the ad revenu that people deserve for being active on their platform.

Edit: I just wanted to mention I very highly look forward to the day when I can buy a Tesla, and it makes more even more proud to own one if Elon is running the business. Also i'm not American.",SkonerTM,0,0,2023-07-29 22:41:01
"A long time ago I worked with a startup founder who had a lot of narcissistic qualities. He would love bomb you when you were initially useful, draw you in with his charm, until something went wrong and he needed a scapegoat who would be bullied, harassed and eventually drummed out of the company.

I realised after a while, a lot of his behaviour was driven by shame. His personal circumstances growing up were genuinely awful. He blamed himself and never really got over it. That's why he was such an awful micromanager; every success _had_ to be his idea. He needed to know _he_ had done something right. But no matter what the company achieved he never seemed any happier.

Did he think he could ""change the world"" with his tech startup? He certainly _spoke_ like it, and that convinction was part of his charm. It was utterly magnetic. Until you realised it was a retreat of something he'd said or done years prior, a promise he'd made and missed back when you first met him.

I do know that his failures weighed on him. He knew that he had not really achieved the goals he wanted, and it cut him deeply. That's why he was so venomously angry... It's also why he was a terrible flirt with employees young enough to be his kids - bordering on sexual harassment... It's why he lied about his age... It's why he pretended to be doing charity work in the middle east when he was actually in a luxury hotel in... It's why he carefully covered his wrinkles in makeup... Even his name wasn't real. It was all fraud.

I think deep down he still hated himself, for the awful things his parents had done to him. He needed his ambition, maybe, as an achievement that would finally absolve him of his original sin.

Whenever a project or company stopped succeeding, he would suddenly lose interest, jump onto something new. There was never any memory of his broken promises because the past was always being discarded in favour of a perpetual ""start-up"".

I empathised with what I understood of him. I didn't sympathise. He was quite content to damage peoples' lives if it protected his psyche. He bullied employees and systematically broke down their confidence.

I don't know Elon Musk. I don't know the chambers of his soul. He does act a lot like my old boss though.",yojimbo_beta,1,0,2023-07-29 00:42:49

"The thing about Musk, is that he's an incredible *storyteller*. 

He's been able to communicate a vision of the future that everyone wants to believe in - a future where humanity is reaching out to colonise the solar system, a future where our cars drive us around like taxis', a future where traffic congestion is solved through underground tunnels, and where we can communicate with computers through just our thoughts. 

And a lot of people really buy into that vision. That's the world they want to live in. It feels Star Trek, but it's happening within our lifetimes rather than the far future. 

So when people see a Tesla, that's what they think off. Musk has generated a brand and a mythology that people want to believe in - so they buy Teslas, which are the manifestation of that vision. It not because they are the best cars in the world - far from it. But they communicate that vision of the glittering possibility of humankind. And that vision has turned out to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. 

He's also very lucky. He's taken huge risks with his businesses, and pretty much all of them (apart from Twitter) have paid off. And that's made him enough money that he can pay for the things that don't work out. Buy twitter and it tanks? Not to worry, Tesla is worth a trillion dollars. 

He also seems very good at finding at hiring the best minds. He got some of the brightest engineers in the world working at SpaceX and Tesla, and he's given them what they need to flourish and create some amazing things. 

Is Musk stupid? A stupid person couldn't create what he has. He's prone to making rash and impulsive decisions, and he doesn't always think things through. So he buys twitter and loses $20bn. But that feature has it upsides. If he invests tons on money in a project and it's not working out, he'll can the whole thing before it gets out of hand, where other business types would press on and end up losing more in the long run. So he can be agile and adaptable as often as foolhardy. 

So he's not as stupid as his detractors think, but he's not as smart as his fans think either. His greatest power is to give people a story of the future they want to believe in.",Sattalyte,0,0,2023-07-28 21:59:04
"Eh I can kind of see where he's coming from here.  Hyperbolic statements like ""sugar is poison"" take fact based advice on a topic (too many sugars aren't good for you) and turn them into a nonsense statement that exists only for its shock value.  There can be exception, obviously stuff like diabetes exists and things like lactose intolerance aren't that uncommon.  Overall though if you aren't just woofing down refined sugars and smart about when you consume them (do it after a workout not right before bed) you'll probably be okay.

I can also kind of sympathize with the idea of enjoying the years you've got and not gunning for some textbook optimal diet.  Personally both my parents died before 65 from cancer and I'm not gunning for 100 at this point.  I'm not going to spend hours at the gym and eat kale smoothies but at the same time I'm not going to ignore medical problems, smoke, drink excessively or get substantially overweight since that works against my primary goal of actually enjoying however many years I have to the fullest extent.  That line is going to fall in different places for different people.  Nutrition information is printed on everything or easily accessible on the internet and I don't think any adults are going into this blindly at this point (children are a different issue but all indications to the contrary Elon Musk is an adult).  

All that said we've all seen that boat picture and Elon trying to pull off skinny jeans.  That donut isn't helping but is probably also far from the only bit of unhealthy food he eats.  That along with some other ridiculous health related takes on COVID and vaccination makes him one of the last people on earth I'm going to take dietary advice from and another reason to be disappointed that his viewpoints are so amplified to the extent that they are.  I also have my doubts that he actually believes this stuff with shorten his lifespan significantly and like all of his other projections is probably gauging it off some nonsense statistic he came up with I'm sure if he ends up diabetes or has a heart attack he'll feel cheated in some way because nothing negative is ever the result of his actions.",ObservationalHumor,3,0,2023-07-28 15:29:59
"Elon needs to step down like Steve Jobs did in 2011, and install the ""Tim Cook of Tesla"" instead.

You've got a chronically ill CEO who refuses to get proper treatment, Steve with cancer, and Elon who is seemingly mentally unwell. (Although the major difference being that Steve died not long after).

Both are high profile 'cult' CEOs who managed to build extremely popular products and make the company a lot of money. Steve had the [Reality Distortion Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field), and Elon has whatever the cult around Tesla/Elon should be named.

Both are extremely opinionated, ruthless CEOs that people are scared to get into a lift with, for fear of being fired. Both have an obsession with design and removing unnecessary (in their minds) details from their products. Both are well known to have temper tantrums over minor things that are presented to them.

The CEO is propping up a design executive who is causing the products to be increasingly dated and flawed due to questionable design decisions:

* Apple had the now departed Jony Ive, who together with Steve, were resistant to other sizes of iPhones as companies like Samsung were gaining ever larger market share. Samsung were also providing seemingly basic features that Apple were resistant to include.
* Tesla has Franz von Holzhausen, who together with Elon, seem to be unable to release a car that isn't shaped like an egg. Tesla are also resistant to including features that almost every other electric car includes (actual buttons, Carplay).

Questionable design choices led by CEO lead to public scandals:

* Apple and 'Antenna-gate': ""*You're holding it wrong!*""
* Tesla and the current 'Battery-gate', telling people that they are wrong and incentivising staff to cancel service appointments over it.

People are off the belief that the company would collapse if the high profile CEO of the company should leave (""*Steve would have never let XYZ happen!*"")

However since Tim Cook the 'king of supply chain management' became CEO of Apple, the company has absolutely skyrocketed and is seemingly unstoppable now. Maybe the Tesla shareholders should take notice.",Nooooeel,13,0,2023-07-28 07:48:36
"If you think he’s anything less than a genius, your just not buying the marketing. That is all. The dude spent a considerable amount of time, money and energy in PR pushing the brand of Elon is a genius. And it worked for a long time when he could put his name in big bold letters on the group project and take credit for the successes while blaming others for group failures like hyperlink. Twitter is a prime example of what happens when he’s the sole person responsible for the group. It’s was the first time he fired everyone instead of bought them. The first time he claims to know better than even the engineers that built the platform and it shows.

To be fair I’ve never owned a twitter account because I’ve thought the platform has been hot garbage since it’s inception. The only reason for it’s success has been largely due to it’s corporate marketing friendly nature. As for actual content that is worth time and energy it’s always been lacking. It’s a soapbox tool, which is why he bought it and why conservatives were pissed when they got kicked off the platform for violating the terms and service. 

But anyone that thinks he’s a free speech absolutist is drinking the kool-aid. Since taking over he’s silenced dissident in multiple foreign countries including some authoritarian governments. He’s changed algorithms to boost his own speech over others. Algorithms have been adjusted to push dangerous narratives he’s more in favor of such as Russia being innocent in the war in Ukraine. And he’s used the platform to push his own one sided propaganda in the twitter files and then banned the author when he didn’t tow the line and say exactly what Elon wanted. He’s uses the platform to attack media he dislikes while boosting media he’s in favor of. And he’s allowed the platform to become a playground for white nationalist, extremist and conspiratorial rhetoric and crypto scams.

In short twitter has been reduced to a platform who’s sole intent is to circle jerk off the owner of the platform while runs it like a teenage Reddit moderator that’s just discovered the ban hammer as their most effective tool in the toolbox.",McCool303,1,0,2023-07-25 18:50:43
"I hate Musk and his followers as much as everyone else here, but the big problem with EVs and Tesla's is, that you have no other realistic option because Tesla exceeds in one particular theme: The software and range.

&#x200B;

I drove ID3/5 GTX, Enyaq, Ioniq 5, e-tron and a few more and absolutely nobody came close to the software standard and comfortability of a Tesla (as a whole). I had the chance to test drive a used Tesla 3 from 2020 I think, and it still was a better option than all of its competitors. No other car comes close to the ""petrol""-experience and if you have to charge your Tesla for longer time because you have no other option you have Netflix and Youtube on the big screen or you can play games on it.

&#x200B;

As an example: A new ID3 here costs at the absolute minimum about 40.000€ with no extras in it. But I can buy a used 2019 Tesla 3 Long Range and enhanced Autopilot for 37.000€ (30.000km) with double the range and MUCH more software features and of all things a WORKING software. In the ID3 you dont even get the feature to unlock your car with your phone if you have an iPhone. With the standard ID3 you can't even climatize your car remotely. If you take the ID3 and pump it up with extras so you have the Tesla standard, you almost can buy a new Tesla 3 for the same price.

&#x200B;

Of course, if you have the option to charge the car at your own home, then the story is different. BUT even then, a Tesla Y or X could still be the better option because of the prices of a good car with good software. You have to buy an BMW iX or Mercedes EQ-Series and those cars can and will easily exceed the prices of a Tesla X or Y.

&#x200B;

All other car manufacturers NEED to at least step up their in-car software in addition with the apps on your phone and make them usable for long ranges without a charging box at your own home.

I still don't get it why in so many brands it's still not possible to watch at least Youtube while you are charging. Such a little thing with so much impact IMO.",eNkelll,-2,0,2023-07-28 07:24:02
"Elon Musk is rebranding Twitter -- one of the most recognizable brand names on the planet -- to X. The videos on the site are gonna be called ""X videos."" Face it, the man's a moron and he's running the site into the ground.

>They don't want a platform that allows more free speech than other platforms, and that holds all people to the same standard when combating misinformation with Community Notes (although it's not a perfect tool, it's far more neutral than any previous ""fact-checker"").

My man *admitted* to censoring Turkish opposition at the behest of their government, just because they threatened to ban Twitter. The changes he's made to the Twitter Blue system has made it so that his biggest simps get to clog up the replies of any Tweet, even if they're not as popular as other Tweets. Free speech on Twitter has gone way down the toilet, and it shouldn't be a surprise, given his history of retaliating against journalists.

None of this is to say that his authoritarian leanings don't play a role in the public distaste for Elon Musk, but he's run the site horribly. Up until that point, he had run a decent grift from the top of his other companies like Tesla & SpaceX.

Edit: Should clarify that I haven't found any specific, official source saying the ""X videos"" thing is like, an official term which will be used by X, itself. Just like, it'd be most natural to refer to a video on the social media site, X, as an ""X video"", in the same way as a video on YouTube is a ""YouTube video.""

I'm sure people speaking about X will have the wisdom to word it carefully to avoid that, but the fact that anyone would even have to do that speaks to how shitty this name change is.",derelictdickweed,101,0,2023-07-24 13:23:47
"I don't think it's that simple.  I believe that on an unconscious level his mind absolutely knows he's a fraud which is why he is so desperately unhappy and why he takes this out on others.  I think that's why he does so many drugs as well - an attempt to escape from himself.  On a conscious level I think he completely believes his own nonsense and has no self-awareness as to why he is so unhappy - although I'm sure he blames it in many things beside himself.

His distrust and outright hatred of psychiatry is telling and what it tells me is that he's seen a therapist and has been diagnosed with one of several (or perhaps several) personality disorders, has utterly rejected the diagnosis (not uncommon) and seeks justification for himself in the mistaken belief that the science of psychology is somehow false.

Here is what we, without a doubt, know about him so far:

- He has vastly inflated self-worth and prone to delusions of grandeur.

- He is a consummate liar and manipulator

- he displays strong narcissistic tendencies 

- he flagrantly violates laws when it suits his purpose

- He is sadistic and has a lowered emotional awareness of others.

- he is unable to form long-term relationships

- He is emotionally and socially stunted

- he has poor impulse control and takes unnecessary risks

I can think of three or four personality disorders that would fit this above - but the short version is that he is almost a complete psychiatric basket-case - yet a high functioning one (so far).  Why people tend to put such weirdos into positions of power and esteem, and have been doing so for many thousands of years, is a complete mystery to me.",AuntieSocial_Media,35,0,2023-07-28 05:29:12
">The people that have flipflopped to dislike Twitter (Elon Musk), only dislike the platform because Elon Musk has political stances that they find unacceptable. 

False, people dislike him because he made a series of choices that basically caused his progressive mask to fall out. One of them claims to want to buy Twitter in order to protect people who drop racial slurs.

>They don't want a platform that allows more free speech than other platforms, and that holds all people to the same standard when combating misinformation with Community Notes (although it's not a perfect tool, it's far more neutral than any previous ""fact-checker""). 

He banned people for disagreeing with him. He banned an account that posted every time a Tesla caught fire. So we know that his version of free speech isn't really free.

>The hype around Threads was only because they hate Musk, and none of these people actually

It probably didn't help that Musk ruined the website but this is basic capitalism. Musk is suck a fuck up. He made someone who's taken part of genocide look good.

>would assist them in advancing political objectives and allow them to freely spread their own misinformation. 

It actively bans people for speeding misinformation. I feel like the complaints here are secretly about who those people have been.

>People rant about this because they're clinging for any reason to hate and to try to justify their viewpoint that Twitter is collapsing, which it doesn't seem to be going anywhere and that enrages them.

"Rightist creeps like Musk love to insinuate or flat out push the horseshit notion that liberals/progressives are tolerant of or even pro-child trafficking. 

Musk several months ago publicly engaged on Twitter with Lara Logan, the disgraced former CBS News reporter who has morphed into a far-right conspiracy troll. Musk and Logan  smeared the content management team in place at Twitter when Musk took over (which naturally Musk fired)  as squishy-soft on Twitter sexual predators.      
 
Typically for a conservative ass clown who owns a media platform, Musk’s “free speech is inviolate” mantra seems to actually  cover for a laissez-faire attitude toward  the vilest content,  from misogynistic and transphobic hatred/harassment to child pornography. 

A good analogy of conservative hypocrisy is  Ronald Reagan presenting himself as passionately anti-abortion during his 1976, 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns despite signing in 1967 as California governor one of the most permissive abortion laws in the country. 

Of course, Reagan’s grasp on truth in the past was always sketchy to say the least. Reagan told  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir during a 1983 meeting that Reagan had helped film the Allied liberation of Nazi death camps in Europe during World War II. Reagan repeated this claim in 1984 to Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal. In truth, Reagan never left the United States during the entirety of the war; he was based in Hollywood, making public relations / training films for the U.S. Army Air Corps.

"At this point i consider Mr. Husk a grandiose narcissist. While i do not know him personally and am not educated enough to diagnose him, i consider this a very well working hypothesis. 

He obviously has a sense of entitlement, but i do think that his self-worth is tied to it. I believe that his followers serve as his narcissist supply. They (and the public at large) constantly have to replenish his self-worth or else he will collapse. That might even be the reason for buying Twitter. The circus is the point - the attention is the point. 


I am not sure, if the whole emerald mine story counts as gaslighting the public. He probably shows (some part of) his true self on Twitter. People, who cannot consider others as people, easily get bigoted worldview. Add to that the genius cult of the far-right and you get a person like Husk. Narcissists have a false self that they show the public. I believe that his false self was the persona he showed as the ""founder"" of Tesla. 

If their supply is threatened, narcissists might collapse and do irrational, hurried and panicked decisions to refocus attention onto themselves. That might be the renaming of Twitter. Even negative attention is better for him than being irrelevant. 

To finally answer your question: I believe that he has a giant ego. And he considers any real world critic an attack on his self-worth and thus a treat (since the diver story). Under this premise it might have been inevitable that he would believe himself a genius.",Ahornwiese,5,0,2023-07-28 04:42:50
"Saw a really striking dissection of this whole ordeal recently. Elon bought a social media platform for $44b. That's more than enough to pay for an entirely new app and its marketing, to be a new competitor on the scene. Clearly, Elon didn't want a *new* social media platform. Then, what was he after?

Twitter had a massive pool of experienced workers in every necessary field. Elon fired almost all of them: people and expertise were not his reason for purchasing Twitter. There's a large codebase created by said experts, but Elon feels the app needs a rewrite from the ground up. The source code was not worth $44b, apparently. The company had a fairly solid, net-zero advertisement cashflow. Not great, but a very good start. Elon obliterated ad revenue - he did not buy Twitter for the advertisement base. Twitter was never the largest social media platform, but it's up there: people wanted to use Twitter. Elon decided to alienate a large swath of users, and drives away new engagement. Elon did not want the userbase. 

So, Elon didn't want *any* of that. What's left after stripping all of that away? Ah, right, branding! Everyone knows Twitter, and people grow up knowing what a Tweet is: if ""tweeting"" is not in dictionaries, it's a matter of time. That's pretty much invaluable, it could honestly be worth more than fourty billion dollars. 

And now, here we are. Elon is discarding the branding of his newly-acquired brand.

"I’m in the camp that he always believed his own hype from day one. Mans did some interesting things with computers in the 90s or 00s or so, and he got such a hard on from the validation that he received that he’s sure that he’s this big genius that improves everything he touches.  
I can recognize the behavior patterns he at least shows publicly cuz when I was a small lad I had the exact same problem. I was ahead of kids my age by like a whole grade or two by some metric or another and I was so sure that I was the smartest kid in school and everyone else was below me that when I lost a random spelling bee one day I went completely neurotic with despair and rage, and I tried (and failed because I was low key wimpy as shit) to take my feelings out on everyone in the playground with my fists, with the intent to find the winner and literally murder her with my bare hands (again, a feat I would likely have failed miserably at had I had the chance) because I thought she must have somehow sabotaged the contest. After a very very stern talking to by a school councilor and a lot of other things, I was very self conscious about my possible ego ever since.  
Elon never had a spelling bee moment cuz his money saved him and he has enough yes men around him to simply discredit his opponents.  
There’s a chance I’m projecting a bit and maybe he’s just a total grifter all along but I still feel at least somewhat confident that I recognize his immature arrogance",sweetTartKenHart2,3,0,2023-07-28 04:39:34
"More important here. If you live in Ohio, get your ass into your local early voting location and vote no on Issue 1. Two major reasons why you should.

If Issue One passes...

1. Votes for state constitutional amendments goes from 50% +1 to 60% +1 to pass. If an issue gets 59% of the vote, it still fails.

2. Required signatures goes from 10% of the total votes cast for governor in the last election (425,000), to 5% of the registered voters in each county. Here you would need to collect slightly fewer signatures, but getting 5% in every county is impossible and depending on what you are asking people to sign it could be dangerous considering you'd have to go door to door in rural counties. You could get 2 million signatures to get something on the ballot but if you only get 5% of the signatures in 87/88 counties, it doesn't go to ballot.

You have up through the special election date of AUG 8TH to vote. Despite the fact that our legislature passed a law banning special elections just this winter, SoS still set the election for Aug to get ahead of the amendment vote to enshrine Pro Choice abortion access into our constitution, and the state supreme court let the special election go through, essentially tell the whole state that special.

"I honestly believe this is what happened. Elon wanted to pump up Twitter stock by saying he was going to buy it for x amount, then short that stock and back out of the deal. The stock would have fallen a ton and he would make a ton. But his idiocy caught up to him and he was forced to go through with the deal.

Now he is stuck with a company that doesn't really make any money and is a money black hole. Maybe he can't dismantle it and sell off it's assets due to his ego or some contractual obligation, whatever reason he has decided he is going to ""run"" this company.

The problem is he has no idea how to run a company. Every other company he has bought has either been sold really fast for profit, or they quickly figured out how to handle Elon while still working. SpaceX had people who would make Elon's dumbass requests sound better, or make sense to the people actually working.

Problem is Twitter is not like that and is very public facing unlike his other ventures. So he makes an ass of himself and that hurts the company. He makes bad and worse decisions and that also hurts the company often leading to lawsuits and the situation where the dipshit fired the only guy who could do the security badges so the next day no one could get in.

It’s why he endlessly creates new companies seemingly on a whim just to eventually abandon it for some new project. Elon wants the thrill of being the guy who builds the next big thing.  

Elon goes apeshit when people criticize him or point out his faults and the fact he isn’t as brilliant as he says he is because on some level, he knows they are right; and this fact will forever be a thorn in his psyche. That deep down, he knows he is a fraud and grifter. Elon craves endless validation from everyone and anyone he knows. It’s why he can’t form long term meaningful connections with anyone. It’s why he tried finding validation in being father despite the fact he doesn’t seem to actually care about the emotional connections that come with fatherhood. It’s why he bought Twitter and it’s why he is trying to shape it as he has. He wants an app to open that will shower endless praise and applause onto him, he wants his fans to tell him how smart and funny and cool he is.

Read limiting on a modern social media site - a site that will passively load at least 10 tweets ahead on the activity you're currently on - sounds like an unfunny joke that a techy lib would make to dunk on twitter, but it's reality. He's weighing them all the same too; streaming a single video 10 minute video takes more data than pulling every single text tweet ever liked by the average twitter user, but you can do the former 300 times in 5 minutes, and the latter would take you weeks unless you pay for ~~Twitter~~ X Blue, because Elon doesn't understand the web.

Every single one of his changes is a lesson in best practice, because everything he's done is worst practice. Each choice he's made is both unorthodox and bad on its face.

It is a colossal barrier to entry for any competitor and is Twitter's most valuable asset even though it's completely intangible. The Twitter launch in 2006/2007 was one of the most well crafted and beautifully executed campaigns of all time. It should be written about in marketing textbooks and studied in business schools. Honestly, Ashton Kutcher should have been made CEO of Twitter cuz he did more to get users to sign up that crucial first year than anybody that works there. Threads didn't have such a campaign. They instead tried to take advantage of people's frustrations with Musk which just isn't a strong enough force to get a critical mass of people to switch.

When a safer more traditional (used for 30+ years for tetanus, shingles, etc.) protein based vaccine called Novavax became available I took that instead.  It was like night and day compared to mRNA.

People must realize that this is a direct effect of mRNA.  Many people who took mRNA have much more severe reactions than previous vaccines they took, myself included.

  
The effects on human immune system are elevated with mRNA, leading to issues such as inflammation, myocarditis, autoimmune etc.  When I had my mRNA doses I had severe reactions, I had no reactions with all my previous vaccinations.  This convinced me to stop taking mRNA.  

  
When a safer more traditional (used for 30+ years for tetanus, shingles, etc.) protein based vaccine called Novavax became available I took that instead.  It was like night and day compared to mRNA.  With Novavax I had no reaction at all.  This proves to me that Novavax is much better/safer.",John-Doe-Jane,-4,0,2023-07-26 09:53:41

2. Tesla service centers won't be profit centers. But the service centers are worse than auto dealers. They lie, they over charge and they rip the customer off!
3. The car will be an appreciating asset. Fuck! It is the worst depreciating asset, I have ever owned!
4. FSD will drive coast to coast by 2016 and it is 2023 it can't even do a simple highway driving without phantom breaks.

I don’t like that he can do all of that and more, yet ***still*** avoid any legal consequences whatsoever because he has enough money to pay lawyers and such to hold his cases up in court for pretty much ever. 

I also don’t like him because he complains about crime and poverty in San Francisco which he used to justify not paying his leases there, even though he himself is directly contributing to it. He is also trying to sue ~~facebook~~ meta for hiring people that simply didn’t want to work for a guy like musk anymore.

Maybe it's just me, but I felt like they did a decent job of illustrating the problem with both sides.  Prioritizing either gender in society is wrong, and I feel like they showed the issues on both sides of the coin.  Of course, it was geared towards women; it's a Barbie movie. But I was satisfied with they way they showed that men don't deserve to be ignored, either.  There was plenty of narrative about the Ken's being treated badly and taken for granted and I dont feel like it was supporting that behaviour.  Main ken had his moment to tell Barbie how it hurt him to be mistreated, and the Barbies had to see a world where their feminarchy was challenged. Both sides went too far, so the lesson, as I saw it, was that both sides matter and deserve a voice. And that a world that favours one will lead to oppression of the other.

Women aren't letting men talk, exist or breathe without crucifying them.

“A developmental disorder affecting ability to effectively socialize and communicate.
Asperger syndrome is a condition on the autism spectrum, with generally higher functioning.”

Sound familiar? He’s good at driving companies generally with a big vision and he takes big risks with capital. He’s very bad at understanding a social network which isn’t really a technology problem so much if you’ve scaled. He’s completely domineering as a boss because he thinks he’s right mostly. As he gets older and more successful he’s become a troll because there are so many acolytes and his success speaks for itself. So he behaves like a giant swinging dick even when he’s just winging it. It’s a bit sad because he was actually very good when he built SpaceX and he made game changing decisions at Tesla.

Weird shit like having the steering wheel come off, software driving you into traffic, and god knows what else really channels current American business ethics.

So I say all to say that I think logistically from a technological standpoint he doesn’t know or care how twitter runs, he’s essentially using it as a rental car that he bought the insurance on, he’s gonna ride it till the reels fall off, continue to talk a big game about what he’s gonna do or what is about to happen (same as he’s done with all his other companies) and in the end nothing of real substance will come to fruition.

And I hate to tell you but Twitter is vastly more superior now. It's really not that different, rampant racism and garbage political takes, people getting doxxed by angry crowds for out-of-context clips, the only difference is that Twitter itself takes a more neutral approach instead of allowing blatantly fake information to circulate for a much longer time. Good example is the Citi-Bike Karen ""story"". Within 24 hours, it was community noted and all the idiots that spoke too early were rightfully outed as being racist demagogues, and various editorials from ""news"" websites were deleted left right, and center.

"""Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence"" - Robert J. Hanlon

If you look into his history he's never actually managed any of his businesses, they are usually ran by people who know what they're doing,

In fact this could very likely be his first real job since graduating university,

On top of that Twitter is a software company, so you can make changes faster than people who know what they are doing can convince him not to, if you want to, let's say, slightly change how a car looks it will take a long time before the changes make it through so there's plenty of time for people who know better to come along and fix it,

Like Elons job has always been closer to marketing, using his persona and image as this genius visionary to attract talent, than it has been to actually managing anything (or engineering since he also loves to take credit for his employees work and claim he's involved in everything),

"*tin foil hat time*

Maybe it's secretly a play to cut his losses. Twitter's turned into a money drain and he wants to just stop, but cares so much about his persona among his followers that he can't just sell it/shut it down. He's tried rebranding and messing around a tonne to try and break it, but it just won't die.

So, he starts playing a little fast and loose with the rules about how to deal with CP on the platform. He knows he's mega rich and won't actually go to jail, but law enforcement may come a knocking.

Then he can shut down the site while they ""investigate"" but then never bring it back. Then once that's over, he can claim ""the establishment"" of communist corporate authoritarian Democrat woke lib brigade shut him down with false accusations– you can tell they're false because he's not in prison– just because they couldn't handle his free speech.

If I could take the car to any old mechanic I could comparison shop for the fastest repairs or the best prices, but since no outside mechanic will even _look_ at a Tesla you're stuck paying Tesla repair prices and dealing with Tesla repair times and Tesla repair quality.",TheBlackUnicorn,5,0,2023-07-28 11:58:54
"During Tesla and Space X's rise, people thought of Musk as an engineer building these companies from the ground up and personally impacting development. 

As his fame has grown and his mistakes and missteps have become very public more and more people are just realizing who he really is: A venture capitalist. He did not create or build anything and when parsed, his impacts on the tech development are non existent or even hindering. 

So he went from a scientist/engineer (in the public eye) to just another billionaire pushing his own agenda through his fortune. He went from the exception to the rule in people's perception and it tanked his popularity. 

If anything, the online Right has become more and more a fan of him BECAUSE they like his agenda vs what he has actually done.",VonWolfhaus,12,0,2023-07-24 16:28:35
"Musk is a weirdo who is a bit disconnected from reality.

In some ways, this helped with things like Tesla and SpaceX because it meant he pushed through all of the obstacles that were in the way and he was able to sell his delusion to others, which in business CAN create a positive feedback loop that ends up with someone willing their impractical idea into existence.

Also, a lot of people in general are aligned with Musk on wanting what he wants - cheaper and more efficient access to space, and electric cars.

Twitter isn't that though - it was an already-established company. Musk thinks everyone else wants what he wants, and if he makes Twitter into something he likes, everyone will love it.

But Musk is, again, a weirdo, and most people don't want what he wants w/twitter.",Particular-Court-619,2,0,2023-07-24 22:59:56

He is a narcissist, or seems to be. He's wildly inconsistent, seems to make big, rash business decisions, possibly based on emotional reactions to what people say about him, or how he perceives people to think of him. 

None of this makes him stupid. Apparently he's capable of focusing intensely and working very hard. But these things all add up to being a terrible leader.

I've got a feeling that most people will continue to call it Twitter even after the change.  Just like when Prince changed his name and everyone still called him Prince.  Or when Zuck tried to rebrand Facebook as Meta.  It's still most commonly known as Facebook.

Simply because the X is a cross, expresses a center, a crossroad, and has a outward movement (centrifugal). Which had not the bird, who were on profile and such conveyed a single way expression.

Adult Pornography aims to be sexually arousing to a generally large audience and involves consenting adults.

Indecent images (and videos) of children (IIOC) do unfortunately exist. They are abusive and involve children who cannot consent to their involvement.

The word that could enter the new English lexicon and immediately be associated with his product for all time! Nope, just fucking ""post"". He is *SO STUPID*.
