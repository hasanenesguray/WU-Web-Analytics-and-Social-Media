"Oh it sure is a commercial but sugarcoated in the libfem notion of “feminist empowerment”.

And Mattel is not only the antagonist of the movie, it is also one of the producers. It’s more like the commercial is the main product and the movie is just an excuse for all of it.

Capitalism will use everything, every notion in its own way, sometimes by degrading, sometimes by owning it. Feminism is (or must be) quite the opposite of capitalist society. But rather than making it the enemy visibly, system will look like it owns women’s rights in the form of “empowerment”, sell whatever it can out of it and will degrade the rest as “wokism”, “radicalism”, “crazyness” etc. By this way, no threat to the state or upper classes will be made but some people will get even richer.

"I think Margot is stunning. She is head to toe classical golden Hollywood era beautiful. She’s so photogenic. I don’t think anyone can argue that she’s not stunning if they someone does try to argue it then they’re probably jealous.   
  
She does have sun damage just like everyone else in Australia (I’m Australian btw). She’s wearing makeup in all of the pictures but you can still see a lot of her sun spots like underneath her eyes and there’s some prominent ones on the side of her forehead. They’re kind of blurred but definitely visible in the picture from Instagram you have there. The picture from the MET Gala shows them very clearly especially on her forehead. These types of spots you normally see on people who are older like closer to retirement but they’re common on people in Australia even in their early twenties and thirties. And yeah, her skin is crinklier for her age especially around her eyes and mouth which is from sun damage. ***But, does it make her less beautiful? I say no.***   
  
I don’t know why people pit it against her that she has sun damage or say her bone structure makes her look too mature. It’s not like she got to choose where she was born or her body. She’s still freaking gorgeous. There’s no procedure to my knowledge that can give anyone her big, bright, wide set seaglass eyes and her big smile.  
  
It’s true that Australians look older for their age compared to people in other parts of the world of the same age. The environment is so harsh and you’re still exposed to it on a daily basis if you’re trying to live your life because not even using sunscreen and shade is enough. I did my studies in Boston, USA and did summer road trips with friends through many states. Not that I was intentionally judging anyone but I couldn’t help notice during my first years there how many of my peers, who were mostly American students from all over the country and international students from China and India, looked much younger skin wise than my peers in Australia. Much less spotty  and crinkly around the eyes and more even skintone and just skin that looked firmer and thicker. 

But there are lot of things that can fix that type of stuff especially if you save some money and set aside time. Jealous and bad personalities are harder to fix if they can be fixed at all. I have never seen one of those people who say Margot is bad looking to ever volunteer to post their own pictures. They’re probably the same type of people who need to fish for compliments on social media.  


I don't equate numerical age for beauty and I don't think having bad skin or sun damage and stuff like that is a criteria for beauty. You can be beautiful with amazing personality but bad skin.

"She looks 33. I’m 33. This is how I look. (Well, not a smoke show like her, but the same skin texture and small wrinkles)

The problem is, fillers, Botox, skin peels, etc. are all we see on female celebrities in media and on red carpets. So when a woman who hasn’t had work done is shown, we can’t correlate a normally aged 33 year old woman to the ones who have had plastic surgery or enhancements.

How dare a celeb not go under plastic surgery lol.

I also think we are so used to seeing make up artists doing such a good job hiding every flaw on actors faces they forget what a real face looks like. Make up artists can cover every fine line and wrinkle on your face, they can also change the shape of your face too and also hide hollows so your face looks perfect and smooth and plump. They can also make you look older or younger with make up and add in scars and broken veins or make it look like you have wrinkles.

"The part of the article we should actually be paying attention to:

“They continue to tell men, ‘You have be powerful, violent and in control of your woman - that’s the only way for a man to be successful’. They really double down on exactly the kind of messaging that is harming men in the first place. And if we could provide boys with offline spaces to explore some of the anxieties, fears and frustrations that often send them into the arms of these communities, then that would be a really good way to offset their power. 
It can’t be a coincidence that these communities have risen so sharply in their influence and success at grooming young people at the same time that we’ve seen a massive decline in funding for youth services. Hundreds of youth centres have been forced to shut their doors and boys don’t have that same opportunity offline to create a sense of community, purpose, belonging and brotherhood. That’s what these communities are offering them.”

It has nothing to do with Margot Robbie or the Barbie movie. I don’t know if it was a decision from above or what, but I wish the publication hadn’t used the celebrity example to garner the article attention.

"Just saw it.

Greatest movie I’ve ever seen. 

Gerwig has unseated Kubrick, Kurosawa, and Tarkovsky as the greatest filmmaker of all-time.

She has not only single handedly destroyed the patriarchy, crony capitalism, and the wrongheaded idea that women can’t do everything better than men: she has dared to go where no one has ever gone before: to a toy for inspiration. Never been done. Probably never will be done again.

Brilliant.

It truly took a woman to be the greatest filmmaker of all/time. No man could ever be as subtle, brilliant, and multi-faceted. Its only flaw is that everything else sucks in comparison now.

Seriously: she reframed the creation myth, raised up the Shekinah, queered the heiros gamos, and officially unseated the Demiurge.

"People in this thread are writing that she was so poor and is a hero for this, but first, that is a basic what you can do for your mother when you are a millionaire, and second research the facts about her. Margot was not rich and her father walked out on them but she wasn't like extremely poor either.  She had a home, food on the table - no problem, dancing lessons, and her extended family owns a large farm in Australia where she spent her time - this is literally the official info on her IMDB page. So... you can miss me with sky-high praises for her. 

The truth is she still had/has a lot of privileges. She is white, beautiful, has a classic type of beauty, and she comes from an English-speaking country - all of these elements are advantages in Hollywood if you know this town and the movie business. The aspiring actresses who are black/ of color and those who come to Hollywood with the dream from non-English speaking countries, especially Slavs, have it WAY harder. 

In fact, if you came from Eastern Europe especially, you have it very hard because the language is a fundament in the movie/acting business, and except for the typical cliche 'Russian spy' trope, there isn't much for them in Hollywood. 

For every other role, they have to compete with native English speakers from around not just the US, but Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zeland, etc., and still the Latinas are chosen before Slavic girls (I have seen it, actually, I have a connection to this industry through my friends). The Hispanic and Latino community became quite strong in Hollywood in the last decades and altho they still also face hardships in the business, thanks to the US connection and closeness to South and Central America, and quite a big movie/tv business in South America, they have it easier than Eastern Europeans.
