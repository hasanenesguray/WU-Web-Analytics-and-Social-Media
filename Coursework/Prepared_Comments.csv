"Why buy an iconic brand just to tear it down and start a new one. Just make your own thing. Like, Twitter already had a userbase, true, but they're there to use Twitter, not X. Of course, I doubt this was his endgame from the start. He's proven he can't be relied on to think so much as a few months ahead.

It's like he bought McDonald's and rebranded it as, say, Cluckin' Chuck's and started to lean towards serving mainly chicken rather than burgers, scrapping the iconic golden arches and red-and-yellow colour scheme to make way for an entirely new brand identity. It's idiotic. Any preexisting customers are there *because* of that brand, and since you're changing so many features of the restaurant, you could have just started your own thing. True, this eliminates a potential competitor, but again, the features of both companies differ, so why not just start a new chain and try to lure people over with those new features?",ConkreetMonkey,3,0,2023-07-24 19:26:02,"Why buy an iconic brand just to tear it down and start a new one.

"Each individual post-Elon Twitter decision is my own personal brain worm, and I can't hold in my nerd rage any longer.

He's made read limits to stop scrapping? Read limiting on a modern social media site - a site that will passively load at least 10 tweets ahead on the activity you're currently on - sounds like an unfunny joke that a techy lib would make to dunk on twitter, but it's reality. He's weighing them all the same too; streaming a single video 10 minute video takes more data than pulling every single text tweet ever liked by the average twitter user, but you can do the former 300 times in 5 minutes, and the latter would take you weeks unless you pay for ~~Twitter~~ X Blue, because Elon doesn't understand the web.

"He already owned it. The first company he made back in the day was a banking portal called [x.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com). X.com merged with [Confinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confinity) (which was at the time the only other competitor in the online banking space) and the merged company was called [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal).

"I honestly believe this is what happened. Elon wanted to pump up Twitter stock by saying he was going to buy it for x amount, then short that stock and back out of the deal. The stock would have fallen a ton and he would make a ton. But his idiocy caught up to him and he was forced to go through with the deal.

Now he is stuck with a company that doesn't really make any money and is a money black hole. Maybe he can't dismantle it and sell off it's assets due to his ego or some contractual obligation, whatever reason he has decided he is going to ""run"" this company.

The problem is he has no idea how to run a company. Every other company he has bought has either been sold really fast for profit, or they quickly figured out how to handle Elon while still working. SpaceX had people who would make Elon's dumbass requests sound better, or make sense to the people actually working.

Problem is Twitter is not like that and is very public facing unlike his other ventures. So he makes an ass of himself and that hurts the company. He makes bad and worse decisions and that also hurts the company often leading to lawsuits and the situation where the dipshit fired the only guy who could do the security badges so the next day no one could get in.

“It’s so dumb it’s brilliant! 
“No! It’s just dumb!” 

Musk has no experience in running a business of this nature. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX. They’re not REALLY public facing businesses in the same way Twitter is. Musk is, at his core, a software engineer, or a engineer generally if I am being generous. Twitter has massive exposure to engineering issues obviously, but it’s offering isn’t one you can improve through solving engineering issues. It hasn’t REALLY changed what it does for years, which is basically let people put text on the internet. That’s it. You are never going to revolutionise the core of that, nor should you want to, because if you do you’re losing the point of the platform in the first place. 

That’s why Twitter isn’t about engineering. It’s not about creating something people want to buy or use. Twitter is about people, it’s about communication, it’s about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. This isn’t something he can build. It’s something he has to understand. And he doesn’t understand it. 

He is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. All the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what HE wants and that he is so convinced of his own rightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

On some level, the idea of “X” as a one-stop shop app to do everything isn’t, necessarily, a terrible one. But it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbents which he will have to compete with. 

It’s going to be VERY hard to make those inroads but it isn’t necessarily impossible. However, the way to approach that challenge is NOT by turning off millions of people by taking edgy views on social issues. I for one will never use X in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain Musk is and I’m sure I’m not alone. 

The things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. I’m not saying he’s a bad businessman. He is incredibly successful and wealthy. Sure that could be down to luck, but I doubt all of it is. He has a set of skills. But they’re not relevant for Twitter and everything he’s done so far shouldn’t fill anyone with confidence.

that is why twitter is not about engineering. it is not about creating something people want to buy or use. twitter is about people, it is about communication, it is about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. this is not something he can build. it is something he has to understand. and he does not understand it. 

he is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. all the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what he wants and that he is so convinced of his own brightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

on some level, the idea of “x” as a one-stop shop pp to do everything is not, necessarily, a terrible one. but it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbent which he will have to compete with. 

it is going to be very hard to make those inroads but it is not necessarily impossible. however, the way to approach that challenge is not by turning off millions of people by taking edge views on social issues. i for one will never use x in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain must is and i am sure i am not alone. 

the things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. i am not saying he is a bad businessman. he is incredibly successful and wealthy. sure that could be down to luck, but i doubt all of it is. he has a set of skill. but they are not relevant for twitter and everything he is done so far should not fill anyone with confidence. getting into a business and immediately alienating a sizeable proportion of its user base is, by any merit, a dumb move.","i firmly believe there is no engage . this whole debate is the episode of : “ it is so dumb it is brilliant !

"Tl;Dr: it’s very easy and somewhat common to self diagnose, sometimes ending it there, sometimes as a precursor to seeking an actual diagnosis.

A lot of people (especially women) self-diagnose autism in adulthood. For many of us, it’s all we can feasibly do. There’s a bunch of history and context behind it. Basically, for a long time, only very specific behaviors and differences were recognized as being indicative of autism. A lot of kids missed diagnosis because they appeared “normal”, “smart”, or “social” enough. Sometimes we were troublemakers, sometimes we were “gifted”, sometimes we were just “odd”. Sometimes our differences were internal and nobody realized we were struggling, but just barely succeeding to fit in.
As adults, we realize our experiences align significantly with others who were diagnosed young. Some people are fortunate enough to get evaluated by professionals, who can see through the mask and confirm. Some people don’t want the stigma of an official diagnosis, or encounter barriers to getting one because it’s costly and still viewed as more of a childhood thing.

Overall, Musk’s claim tracks. He certainly has a lot of autistic traits that people criticize him for (but that overall aren’t an excuse for his behavior, especially as an insanely wealthy public figure with a lot of power and influence). Either he’s had a diagnosis for a long time but didn’t talk about it (the stigma is still real, though fading and now almost “cool” in some circles, hence him announcing it), or he did realize it as an adult, and is either confident in his own assessment (unsurprisingly), or has been evaluated, formally or informally, by a professional. Or, he’s self diagnosed and wrong, perhaps playing up the traits he does have. Those traits are real though, I’m sure. They just may or may not be related to autism.",elvenfaery_,2,0,2023-07-24 21:47:09,"Tl;Dr: it is very easy and somewhat common to self diagnose, sometimes ending it there, sometimes as a precursor to seeking an actual diagnosis.

"Nah, it's all because he wants to pretend that his failed company from the late '90s, [x.com](https://x.com), is still around and successful.

so you will just have to put up with automod and a worse overall user experience in the meantime.

^(cannot wait for everywhere to get flooded by spasm when the admits finally kill off the moderation both that we rely on to prevent spambots)

if you have any complaints, direct them at [the credit admits instead]([LINK] because they are the ones seeking to ruin everyone is user experience.
