"""Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence"" - Robert J. Hanlon

If you look into his history he's never actually managed any of his businesses, they are usually ran by people who know what they're doing,

In fact this could very likely be his first real job since graduating university,

On top of that Twitter is a software company, so you can make changes faster than people who know what they are doing can convince him not to, if you want to, let's say, slightly change how a car looks it will take a long time before the changes make it through so there's plenty of time for people who know better to come along and fix it,

Like Elons job has always been closer to marketing, using his persona and image as this genius visionary to attract talent, than it has been to actually managing anything (or engineering since he also loves to take credit for his employees work and claim he's involved in everything),

Why?

Because the Reddit Admins have decided that [they want to kill off all 3rd-party apps](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), [3rd-party bots, and everything else that makes Reddit barely usable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/).

So you'll just have to put up with automod and a worse overall user experience in the meantime.
