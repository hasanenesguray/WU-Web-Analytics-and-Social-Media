"This is evident with the differences between him and Zuckerburg's poo watching policies

Elon Musk saw this in one of the slack channels

https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/031/634/guy-fired-over-meme-job-work-post-facebook-cody-hidalgo-fb.png

And he replied to it with a giant wall of text basically saying that he's 44 billion dollars in debt, made a bunch of sacrifices, and the employees are the ones making money.

But that's not all.

Elon Musk now has been going into bathrooms now and if he see's someone sitting in on the stalls, he pops his head over to talk to them about their projects in order to make sure they aren't pooping longer than necessary and stealing company time.

The meme seems to really gotten under his skin.

after Elon started doing it he bragged to mark zuckerburg about it, but then mark sent him this meme

https://i.imgflip.com/77us2q.jpg context


In the early days of facebook Mark Zuckerburg would wander into the company bathrooms and if he noticed someone sitting down in the stalls he would pop his head over and try to talk to them about their projects. Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out.

Everyone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated.

That all stopped when Michael Moritz, legendary silicon valley investor, and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders, was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding. He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that's when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how's the diligence coming along.

Michael Moritz, not one to mince words, was apoplectic. 'GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER.' Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted, because he really loved intimate poop conversations 'Aw c'mon Michael, it's silicon valley'. Zuckerburg then withdrew after Moritz flung his cellphone into his eye socket. 

30 minutes later, Mark was in a very import meeting (where he banned questions about his black eye) when Moritz walked into the conference room. 'Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg, OUT'. As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg, at the time Moritz was the bigger deal, and they all scurried out of the room.

Zuckerburg, however, is not one to be intimated by anyone. Not the Winkewoz twins, not Eduardo Savarn, not Peter Thiel, and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz. Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice, but Michael Moritz was having none of that. Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR nightmare, and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued, which would have been a catastrophe for the company.

Zuckerburg pretended to arbitrate 'Ok fine, but you need to give me a good reason, because if it were normal, there would be no problem'.

Moritz was flabberghasted at this response. Was this a serious question? He answered with the most obvious answer 'Because.... it's not FUCKING NORMAL'.

Unknown to Moritz, Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall, and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands. Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage, but Zuckerburg was a master strategist.

Zuckerburg went for the pounce. 'Okay, I'll lets write out an agreement, in writing I'll rescind the policy because it's not normal'. Moritz was dumbfounded, but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders, afterall he was also an early investor in Apple, and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs. Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence.

When Moritz left, a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg's face. "" 'Not Normal' eh? "" Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh. Ever since then, Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life-long crusade to normalize poop conversations.

He had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this. His advisors would tell him it's impossible, but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list. From normalizing smart phone use on the toilet (actually a collaboration between Mark Zuckerburg and Steve Jobs), to trusting Mark with their private photos, to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy.

In 2015, Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall, having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap. That's when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus, and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality. If he could coax people into having life-like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality, then doing it in the real world wouldn't be too big of a leap.

Do you read facebook or instagram while you're pooping? Ever consider what urges you to do that? It's not your personal preference, it's by Mark Zuckerburg's design.

Zuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized.

Mark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop.

Are you going to let him?

EDIT, UPDATE

I just got this in my DM. 

>I am a ex Facebook worker. Everything you said rings true. I speak to you at the risk of consequences for breaking my NDA. When I was at Facebook I was involved in a program called Project PooPal. Mark Zuckerburg was planning on Meta entering the exploding tele-therapy space, but targeting people who are not ready to talk to an actual person. You talk to a virtual reality therapist who responds with what is described as the greatest AI (though whatever you tell it, it only responds with 'wow, tell me more'). The thing is, the virtual reality assistant has a striking resemblance to Mark Zuckerburg himself. But the most damning aspect is that it's supposed to used only when you're pooping. This feature is described as optional, though uses the most advanced AI for your phone camera to check if you're actually on a toilet, and if not, says 'It looks like you're not pooping. Please start pooping and try again'. I always wondered what is the purpose and origin of the project.

"I have been warning about this for 2 years. Hopefully now that someone famous brings attention to it, science will stop being suspended and the necessary research (that was largely deliberately avoided thus far) will finally start being completed.

Of course when I posted this in mainstream subs it was censored by those who claim to be progressive and pro-freedom of speech:

It is hypothesized by experts that it is the spike protein of this virus that is associated with health issues. Keep in mind that China has around 40 000 wet markets, the virus popped up in the only wet market in the only city with the only virology institute in the country that was doing coronavirus research. Keep in mind that the Challenger, Chernobyl, Ohio train spill, and 1000s of other factual historical events show that humans are generally bad at maintaining safety standards 100% of the time and that doing risky activities/research is a matter of when, not if, things will accidentally go wrong. Keep in mind that there was a ban on the type of research done at Wuhan, but in late 2017 the ban expired and was not continued. A couple years later the pandemic happened.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(18)30006-9/fulltext

https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-lifts-3-year-ban-funding-risky-virus-studies

Keep in mind that the accidental lab leak hypothesis was 100% rejected/ignored (up to recently: now, many of the world's experts in this field appear to be open to it), and the vaccine was immediately based on the novel spike protein of this novel virus that there is no evidence of where it comes from (keep in mind the original SARS virus, in a few weeks the animal host was immediately identified), while no other virus in the past had a spike protein that independently was associated with issues. Keep in mind that vaccine injuries from the covid vaccines are rare, though the few people who do have vaccine injuries appear to have the same symptoms as those with long covid from the virus. 

Also, according to government of Western Australia data, the covid vaccines have a 24 times higher risk of adverse effects compared to other vaccines.

https://www.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Corp/Documents/Health-for/Immunisation/Western-Australia-Vaccine-Safety-Surveillance-Annual-Report-2021.pdf

From page 2:

>In WA, the total AEFI rate following a COVID-19 vaccine was 264.1 per 100,000 doses.
...
There were 1,808,050 individual doses of non-COVID-19 vaccines recorded in the AIR in 2021, giving a total AEFI rate of 11.1 events per 100,000 doses, which is similar to the reported 2020 rate of 12.4 per 100,000 doses.

Check page 33 to see breakdown by symptoms. For example, it shows of all people in that time period who had a non covid vaccine, a total of 1 person reported chest pain, compared to 1404 reports of chest pain in those with a covid vaccine. 1 vs 98 respectively for myocarditis. Logically, statistically, rationally, can this be a coincidence? Keep in mind there was no significant difference in terms of rate of adverse effects between type of covid vaccine technology (i.e., mRNA vs ""traditional""): all the covid vaccines more or less had the same astronomically higher (around 24 times) rate of adverse effects than other vaccines. So logically, how can it be the vaccine technology/the actual vaccine itself causing this higher rate. To me, using basic logic, I would assume the content of the vaccine would warrant a closer look. All of the covid vaccines either directly or indirectly result in the production of the novel spike protein of this novel virus in the human body.

See the following articles, the first presented to the American Heart Association, the other done by researchers at Harvard Medical School:

https://newsroom.heart.org/news/coronavirus-spike-protein-activated-natural-immune-response-damaged-heart-muscle-cells

>“Our study provides two pieces of evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike  protein does not need ACE2 to injure the heart. First, we found that the  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injured the heart of lab mice. Different from  ACE2 in humans, ACE2 in mice does not interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike  protein, therefore, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not injure the heart by  directly disrupting ACE2 function. Second, although both the SARS-CoV-2  and NL63 coronaviruses use ACE2 as a receptor to infect cells, only the  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacted with TLR4 and inflamed the heart  muscle cells. Therefore, our study presents a novel, ACE2-independent  pathological role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, ” Lin said.

https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061025

>Conclusions:
Immunoprofiling  of vaccinated adolescents and young adults revealed that the mRNA  vaccine–induced immune responses did not differ between individuals who  developed myocarditis and individuals who did not. However, free spike  antigen was detected in the blood of adolescents and young adults who  developed post-mRNA vaccine myocarditis, advancing insight into its  potential underlying cause.

Here is more research showing that the novel spike protein from this novel virus, unlike the spike protein of any other virus, independently is associated with damage:

[ LINK ] [ LINK ] Deep in mind that the accidental lab leak hypothesis was [ SIZE ] % rejected / ignored ( up to recently : now , many of the world ' s experts in this field appear to be open to it ) , and the vaccine was immediately based on the novel spike protein of this novel virus that there is no evidence of where it comes from ( keep in mind the original SARS virus , in a few weeks the animal host was immediately identified ) , while no other virus in the past had a spike protein that independently was associated with issues . Deep in mind that vaccine injuries from the could vaccines are rare , though the few people who do have vaccine injuries appear to have the same symptoms as those with long could from the virus . Also , according to government of Western Australia data , the could vaccines have a [ SIZE ] times higher risk of adverse effects compared to other vaccines . [ LINK ] From page [ SIZE ] : > In of , the total AEFI rate following a COVID - [ SIZE ] vaccine was [ SIZE ] per [ SIZE ] , [ SIZE ] doses . . . . There were [ SIZE ] , [ SIZE ] , [ SIZE ] individual doses of non - COVID - [ SIZE ] vaccines recorded in the AIR in [ SIZE ] , giving a total AEFI rate of [ SIZE ] events per [ SIZE ] , [ SIZE ] doses , which is similar to the reported [ SIZE ] rate of [ SIZE ] per [ SIZE ] , [ SIZE ] doses . Check page [ SIZE ] to see breakdown by symptoms . For example , it shows of all people in that time period who had a non could vaccine , a total of [ SIZE ] person reported chest pain , compared to [ SIZE ] reports of chest pain in those with a could vaccine . [ SIZE ] vs [ SIZE ] respectively for myocarditis . Magically , statistical , rationally , can this be a coincidence ? Deep in mind there was no significant difference in terms of rate of adverse effects between type of could vaccine technology ( i . e . , mRNA vs "" traditional "" ) : all the could vaccines more or less had the same astronomically higher ( around [ SIZE ] times ) rate of adverse effects than other vaccines . So logical , how can it be the vaccine technology / the actual vaccine itself causing this higher rate . To me , using basic logic , I would assume the content of the vaccine would warrant a closer look . All of the could vaccines either directly or indirectly result in the production of the novel spike protein of this novel virus in the human body . See the following articles , the first presented to the American Heart Association , the other done by researches at Harvard Medical School : [ LINK ] > “ Our study provides two pieces of evidence that the SARS - of - [ SIZE ] spike protein does not need ACE2 to injure the heart . First , we found that the SARS - of - [ SIZE ] spike protein injured the heart of lab mice . Different from ACE2 in humans , ACE2 in mice does not interact with SARS - of - [ SIZE ] spike protein , therefore , SARS - of - [ SIZE ] spike protein did not injure the heart by directly disrupting ACE2 function . Second , although both the SARS - of - [ SIZE ] and NL63 coronaviruses use ACE2 as a receptor to infect cells , only the SARS - of - [ SIZE ] spike protein interested with TLR4 and inflamed the heart muscle cells . Therefore , our study presents a novel , ACE2 - independent pathological role of the SARS - of - [ SIZE ] spike protein , ” In said . [ LINK ] > Conclusions : Immunoprofiling of vaccinated adolescents and young adults revealed that the mRNA vaccine – induced immune responses did not differ between individuals who developed myocarditis and individuals who did not . However , free spike antigen was detected in the blood of adolescents and young adults who developed post - mRNA vaccine myocarditis , advancing insight into its potential underlying because . Were is more research showing that the novel spike protein from this novel virus , unlike the spike protein of any other virus , independently is associated with damage : [ LINK ] [ LINK

"I firmly believe there is no endgame. This whole debacle is the epitome of:

“It’s so dumb it’s brilliant! 
“No! It’s just dumb!” 

Musk has no experience in running a business of this nature. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX. They’re not REALLY public facing businesses in the same way Twitter is. Musk is, at his core, a software engineer, or a engineer generally if I am being generous. Twitter has massive exposure to engineering issues obviously, but it’s offering isn’t one you can improve through solving engineering issues. It hasn’t REALLY changed what it does for years, which is basically let people put text on the internet. That’s it. You are never going to revolutionise the core of that, nor should you want to, because if you do you’re losing the point of the platform in the first place. 

That’s why Twitter isn’t about engineering. It’s not about creating something people want to buy or use. Twitter is about people, it’s about communication, it’s about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. This isn’t something he can build. It’s something he has to understand. And he doesn’t understand it. 

He is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. All the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what HE wants and that he is so convinced of his own rightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

On some level, the idea of “X” as a one-stop shop app to do everything isn’t, necessarily, a terrible one. But it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbents which he will have to compete with. 

It’s going to be VERY hard to make those inroads but it isn’t necessarily impossible. However, the way to approach that challenge is NOT by turning off millions of people by taking edgy views on social issues. I for one will never use X in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain Musk is and I’m sure I’m not alone. 

The things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. I’m not saying he’s a bad businessman. He is incredibly successful and wealthy. Sure that could be down to luck, but I doubt all of it is. He has a set of skills. But they’re not relevant for Twitter and everything he’s done so far shouldn’t fill anyone with confidence.

"Unfortunately unpopular opinion:

Elon musk has done great work in changing the world to be more sustainable. Remember the 3 R's? Reduce, reuse, recycle.

Tesla helps reduce carbon emissions.

SpaceX refuses rockets, reducing the footprint of the space industry.

Solar city recycles excess electricity generated from your roof back into the power grid. You can get paid for this.

I wholeheartly think that all the Elon hate is wildy undeserved and largely manufactured by those who run the industries he has disrupted in his quest for sustainability. He is one of the very few people actually making meaningful change in what people have bitching about for decades ie doing something about climate change.

Biden hosted an EV summit and didn't invite Tesla, which is the EV company 90% responsible for the growing EV market around the world. Previous to them no car company took EVs seriously since they couldn't generate consumer sentiment like Tesla could. Thats ridiculous, right? Like even objectively ridiculous no matter what view you have on Elon I'd argue.

And now he is revolutionizing social media with his leaps and bounds he is making in the way he is running X (previously Twitter). When internet and social media was small, it was easily justifiable to ban people for any cause, I mean what difference did it make then? Not very much. But now with the evolution of social media, thought structures and what gets shared has real impact on the real world. Social and political movements are created and perpetuated primarily on social media. The president of the United States and other countries address the public through posts now, not just the television.

Remember the [ SIZE ] R ' s ? Reduce , refuse , recycle . Tesla helps reduce carbon missions . SpaceX refuses rickets , reducing the footprints of the space industry . Solar city recycle excess electricity generate from your roof back into the power grid . You can get paid for this . I wholeheartedly think that all the Elon hate is wild undeserved and largely manufactured by those who run the industries he has disrupted in his quest for sustainability . He is one of the very few people actually making meaningful change in what people have itching about for decades in doing something about climate change . Widen posted an of summit and did not invite Tesla , which is the of company [ SIZE ] % responsible for the growing of market around the world . Previous to them no car company took was seriously since they could not generate consumer sentiment like Tesla could . That Is ridiculous , right ? Like even objective ridiculous no matter what view you have on Elon I would argue . And now he is revolutionizing social media with his leaps and bounds he is making in the way he is running X ( previously Twitter ) . When internet and social media was small , it was easily justifiable to ban people for any because , I mean what difference did it make then ? Not very much . But now with the evolution of social media , thought structures and what gets shared has real impact on the real world . Social and political movements are created and perpetrated primarily on social media . The president of the United States and other countries address the public through posts now , not just the television .

"A long time ago I worked with a startup founder who had a lot of narcissistic qualities. He would love bomb you when you were initially useful, draw you in with his charm, until something went wrong and he needed a scapegoat who would be bullied, harassed and eventually drummed out of the company.

I realised after a while, a lot of his behaviour was driven by shame. His personal circumstances growing up were genuinely awful. He blamed himself and never really got over it. That's why he was such an awful micromanager; every success _had_ to be his idea. He needed to know _he_ had done something right. But no matter what the company achieved he never seemed any happier.

Did he think he could ""change the world"" with his tech startup? He certainly _spoke_ like it, and that convinction was part of his charm. It was utterly magnetic. Until you realised it was a retreat of something he'd said or done years prior, a promise he'd made and missed back when you first met him.

I do know that his failures weighed on him. He knew that he had not really achieved the goals he wanted, and it cut him deeply. That's why he was so venomously angry... It's also why he was a terrible flirt with employees young enough to be his kids - bordering on sexual harassment... It's why he lied about his age... It's why he pretended to be doing charity work in the middle east when he was actually in a luxury hotel in... It's why he carefully covered his wrinkles in makeup... Even his name wasn't real. It was all fraud.

I think deep down he still hated himself, for the awful things his parents had done to him. He needed his ambition, maybe, as an achievement that would finally absolve him of his original sin.

Whenever a project or company stopped succeeding, he would suddenly lose interest, jump onto something new. There was never any memory of his broken promises because the past was always being discarded in favour of a perpetual ""start-up"".

I empathised with what I understood of him. I didn't sympathise. He was quite content to damage peoples' lives if it protected his psyche. He bullied employees and systematically broke down their confidence.

I don't know Elon Musk. I don't know the chambers of his soul. He does act a lot like my old boss though.",long time ago worked started founder lot narcissistic quality would love bomb initially useful draw charm something went wrong needed scapegoat would pulled harassed eventually drummed company realised lot behaviour driven shame personal circumstance growing genuinely awful blamed never really got awful micromanager every success idea needed know done something right matter company achieved never seemed happier think could change world teach started certainly spoke like conviction part charm utterly magnetic realised retreat something would said done year prior promise would made missed back first met know failure weighed knew really achieved goal wanted cut deeply venomously angry also terrible flirt employee young enough kiss bordering sexual harassment lied age pretended charity work middle east actually luxury hotel carefully covered wrinkle make even name real fraud think deep still hated awful thing parent done needed ambition maybe achievement would finally absolved original sin whenever project company stopped succeeding would suddenly lose interest jump onto something new never memory broken promise past always discarded favour perpetual start empathised understood sympathy quite content damage people life protected psychic pulled employee systematically broke confidence know elon musk know chamber soul act lot like old bos though,"A long time ago I worked with a started founder who had a lot of narcissistic qualities .

"The thing about Musk, is that he's an incredible *storyteller*. 

He's been able to communicate a vision of the future that everyone wants to believe in - a future where humanity is reaching out to colonise the solar system, a future where our cars drive us around like taxis', a future where traffic congestion is solved through underground tunnels, and where we can communicate with computers through just our thoughts. 

And a lot of people really buy into that vision. That's the world they want to live in. It feels Star Trek, but it's happening within our lifetimes rather than the far future. 

So when people see a Tesla, that's what they think off. Musk has generated a brand and a mythology that people want to believe in - so they buy Teslas, which are the manifestation of that vision. It not because they are the best cars in the world - far from it. But they communicate that vision of the glittering possibility of humankind. And that vision has turned out to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. 

He's also very lucky. He's taken huge risks with his businesses, and pretty much all of them (apart from Twitter) have paid off. And that's made him enough money that he can pay for the things that don't work out. Buy twitter and it tanks? Not to worry, Tesla is worth a trillion dollars. 

He also seems very good at finding at hiring the best minds. He got some of the brightest engineers in the world working at SpaceX and Tesla, and he's given them what they need to flourish and create some amazing things. 

Is Musk stupid? A stupid person couldn't create what he has. He's prone to making rash and impulsive decisions, and he doesn't always think things through. So he buys twitter and loses $20bn. But that feature has it upsides. If he invests tons on money in a project and it's not working out, he'll can the whole thing before it gets out of hand, where other business types would press on and end up losing more in the long run. So he can be agile and adaptable as often as foolhardy. 

So he's not as stupid as his detractors think, but he's not as smart as his fans think either. His greatest power is to give people a story of the future they want to believe in.",thing musk incredible storyteller able communicate vision future everyone want believe future humanity reaching colony solar system future car drive u around like tax future traffic congestion solved underground tunnel communicate computer thought lot people really buy vision world want live feel star happening within lifetime rather far future people see tesla think musk generate brand mythology people want believe buy vesta manifestation vision best car world far communicate vision glittering possibility mankind vision turned worth hundred billion dollar also lucky taken huge risk business pretty much apart twitter paid made enough money pay thing work buy twitter tank worry tesla worth trillion dollar also seems good finding hiring best mind got brightest engineer world working spacex tesla given need flourish create amazing thing musk stupid stupid person could create prone making rash impulsive decision always think thing busy twitter loses price feature upside invest ton money project working whole thing get hand business type would press end losing long run agile adaptable often foolhardy stupid detractor think smart fan think either greatest power give people story future want believe,"The thing about Musk , is that he is an incredible * storyteller * .

"Eh I can kind of see where he's coming from here.  Hyperbolic statements like ""sugar is poison"" take fact based advice on a topic (too many sugars aren't good for you) and turn them into a nonsense statement that exists only for its shock value.

Overall though if you aren't just woofing down refined sugars and smart about when you consume them (do it after a workout not right before bed) you'll probably be okay.

"Elon needs to step down like Steve Jobs did in 2011, and install the ""Tim Cook of Tesla"" instead.

You've got a chronically ill CEO who refuses to get proper treatment, Steve with cancer, and Elon who is seemingly mentally unwell. (Although the major difference being that Steve died not long after).

Both are high profile 'cult' CEOs who managed to build extremely popular products and make the company a lot of money. Steve had the [Reality Distortion Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field), and Elon has whatever the cult around Tesla/Elon should be named.

Both are extremely opinionated, ruthless CEOs that people are scared to get into a lift with, for fear of being fired. Both have an obsession with design and removing unnecessary (in their minds) details from their products. Both are well known to have temper tantrums over minor things that are presented to them.

The CEO is propping up a design executive who is causing the products to be increasingly dated and flawed due to questionable design decisions:

* Apple had the now departed Jony Ive, who together with Steve, were resistant to other sizes of iPhones as companies like Samsung were gaining ever larger market share. Samsung were also providing seemingly basic features that Apple were resistant to include.
* Tesla has Franz von Holzhausen, who together with Elon, seem to be unable to release a car that isn't shaped like an egg. Tesla are also resistant to including features that almost every other electric car includes (actual buttons, Carplay).

Questionable design choices led by CEO lead to public scandals:

* Apple and 'Antenna-gate': ""*You're holding it wrong!*""
* Tesla and the current 'Battery-gate', telling people that they are wrong and incentivising staff to cancel service appointments over it.

People are off the belief that the company would collapse if the high profile CEO of the company should leave (""*Steve would have never let XYZ happen!*"")

However since Tim Cook the 'king of supply chain management' became CEO of Apple, the company has absolutely skyrocketed and is seemingly unstoppable now. Maybe the Tesla shareholders should take notice.",elon need step like steve job size install took tesla instead got ironically ill ceo refuse get proper treatment steve cancer elon seemingly mentally unwell although major difference steve died long high profile cult ceo managed build extremely popular product make company lot money steve reality distortion field link elon whatever cult around tesla elon named extremely opinionated ruthless ceo people scared get lift fear fired possession design removing unnecessary mind detail product well known temper antrum minor thing presented ceo dropping design executive causing product increasingly dated flowed due questionable design decision apple departed bony together steve resistant size iphones company like samsung gaining ever larger market share samsung also providing seemingly basic feature apple resistant include tesla franz von holzhausen together elon seem unable release car shaped like egg tesla also resistant including feature almost every electric car includes actual button barclay questionable design choice led ceo lead public scandal apple antenna gate holding wrong tesla current battery gate telling people wrong incentivising staff cancel service appointment people belief company would collapse high profile ceo company leave steve would never let xyz happen however since took king supply chain management became ceo apple company absolutely skyrocketed seemingly unstoppable maybe tesla shareholder take notice,"Elon needs to step down like Steve Jobs did in [ SIZE ] , and install the "" Him Took of Tesla "" instead .

"If you think he’s anything less than a genius, your just not buying the marketing. That is all. The dude spent a considerable amount of time, money and energy in PR pushing the brand of Elon is a genius. And it worked for a long time when he could put his name in big bold letters on the group project and take credit for the successes while blaming others for group failures like hyperlink. Twitter is a prime example of what happens when he’s the sole person responsible for the group. It’s was the first time he fired everyone instead of bought them. The first time he claims to know better than even the engineers that built the platform and it shows.

To be fair I’ve never owned a twitter account because I’ve thought the platform has been hot garbage since it’s inception. The only reason for it’s success has been largely due to it’s corporate marketing friendly nature. As for actual content that is worth time and energy it’s always been lacking. It’s a soapbox tool, which is why he bought it and why conservatives were pissed when they got kicked off the platform for violating the terms and service. 

But anyone that thinks he’s a free speech absolutist is drinking the kool-aid. Since taking over he’s silenced dissident in multiple foreign countries including some authoritarian governments. He’s changed algorithms to boost his own speech over others. Algorithms have been adjusted to push dangerous narratives he’s more in favor of such as Russia being innocent in the war in Ukraine. And he’s used the platform to push his own one sided propaganda in the twitter files and then banned the author when he didn’t tow the line and say exactly what Elon wanted. He’s uses the platform to attack media he dislikes while boosting media he’s in favor of. And he’s allowed the platform to become a playground for white nationalist, extremist and conspiratorial rhetoric and crypto scams.

In short twitter has been reduced to a platform who’s sole intent is to circle jerk off the owner of the platform while runs it like a teenage Reddit moderator that’s just discovered the ban hammer as their most effective tool in the toolbox.",think anything le genius buying marketing due spent considerable amount time money energy pushing brand elon genius worked long time could put name big bold letter group project take credit success blaming others group failure like hyperlink twitter prime example happens sole person responsible group first time fired everyone instead bought first time claim know better even engineer built platform show fair never owned twitter account thought platform hot garage since inception reason success largely due corporate marketing friendly nature actual content worth time energy always lacking soapbox tool bought conservative passed got kicked platform violating term service anyone think free speech absolutism drinking fool aid since taking silenced dissent multiple foreign country including authoritarian government changed algorithm boost speech others algorithm adjusted push dangerous narrative favor russia innocent war ukraine used platform push one sided propaganda twitter file banner author tow line say exactly elon wanted us platform attack medium dislike boasting medium favor allowed platform become playground white nationalist extremist conspiratorial rhetoric crept scar short twitter reduced platform sole intent circle jerk owner platform run like teenage edit moderate discovered ban hammer effective tool toolbox,"Of you think he is anything less than a genius , your just not buying the marketing .

"I hate Musk and his followers as much as everyone else here, but the big problem with EVs and Tesla's is, that you have no other realistic option because Tesla exceeds in one particular theme: The software and range.

&#x200B;

I drove ID3/5 GTX, Enyaq, Ioniq 5, e-tron and a few more and absolutely nobody came close to the software standard and comfortability of a Tesla (as a whole). I had the chance to test drive a used Tesla 3 from 2020 I think, and it still was a better option than all of its competitors. No other car comes close to the ""petrol""-experience and if you have to charge your Tesla for longer time because you have no other option you have Netflix and Youtube on the big screen or you can play games on it.

&#x200B;

As an example: A new ID3 here costs at the absolute minimum about 40.000€ with no extras in it. But I can buy a used 2019 Tesla 3 Long Range and enhanced Autopilot for 37.000€ (30.000km) with double the range and MUCH more software features and of all things a WORKING software. In the ID3 you dont even get the feature to unlock your car with your phone if you have an iPhone. With the standard ID3 you can't even climatize your car remotely. If you take the ID3 and pump it up with extras so you have the Tesla standard, you almost can buy a new Tesla 3 for the same price.

&#x200B;

Of course, if you have the option to charge the car at your own home, then the story is different. BUT even then, a Tesla Y or X could still be the better option because of the prices of a good car with good software. You have to buy an BMW iX or Mercedes EQ-Series and those cars can and will easily exceed the prices of a Tesla X or Y.

&#x200B;

All other car manufacturers NEED to at least step up their in-car software in addition with the apps on your phone and make them usable for long ranges without a charging box at your own home.

I still don't get it why in so many brands it's still not possible to watch at least Youtube while you are charging.

"Elon Musk is rebranding Twitter -- one of the most recognizable brand names on the planet -- to X. The videos on the site are gonna be called ""X videos."" Face it, the man's a moron and he's running the site into the ground.

>They don't want a platform that allows more free speech than other platforms, and that holds all people to the same standard when combating misinformation with Community Notes (although it's not a perfect tool, it's far more neutral than any previous ""fact-checker"").

My man *admitted* to censoring Turkish opposition at the behest of their government, just because they threatened to ban Twitter. The changes he's made to the Twitter Blue system has made it so that his biggest simps get to clog up the replies of any Tweet, even if they're not as popular as other Tweets. Free speech on Twitter has gone way down the toilet, and it shouldn't be a surprise, given his history of retaliating against journalists.

None of this is to say that his authoritarian leanings don't play a role in the public distaste for Elon Musk, but he's run the site horribly. Up until that point, he had run a decent grift from the top of his other companies like Tesla & SpaceX.

Edit: Should clarify that I haven't found any specific, official source saying the ""X videos"" thing is like, an official term which will be used by X, itself. Just like, it'd be most natural to refer to a video on the social media site, X, as an ""X video"", in the same way as a video on YouTube is a ""YouTube video.""

"I don't think it's that simple.  I believe that on an unconscious level his mind absolutely knows he's a fraud which is why he is so desperately unhappy and why he takes this out on others.  I think that's why he does so many drugs as well - an attempt to escape from himself.  On a conscious level I think he completely believes his own nonsense and has no self-awareness as to why he is so unhappy - although I'm sure he blames it in many things beside himself.

His distrust and outright hatred of psychiatry is telling and what it tells me is that he's seen a therapist and has been diagnosed with one of several (or perhaps several) personality disorders, has utterly rejected the diagnosis (not uncommon) and seeks justification for himself in the mistaken belief that the science of psychology is somehow false.

Here is what we, without a doubt, know about him so far:

- He has vastly inflated self-worth and prone to delusions of grandeur.

- He is a consummate liar and manipulator

- he displays strong narcissistic tendencies 

- he flagrantly violates laws when it suits his purpose

- He is sadistic and has a lowered emotional awareness of others.

- he is unable to form long-term relationships

- He is emotionally and socially stunted

- he has poor impulse control and takes unnecessary risks

I can think of three or four personality disorders that would fit this above - but the short version is that he is almost a complete psychiatric basket-case - yet a high functioning one (so far).

">The people that have flipflopped to dislike Twitter (Elon Musk), only dislike the platform because Elon Musk has political stances that they find unacceptable. 

False, people dislike him because he made a series of choices that basically caused his progressive mask to fall out. One of them claims to want to buy Twitter in order to protect people who drop racial slurs.

>They don't want a platform that allows more free speech than other platforms, and that holds all people to the same standard when combating misinformation with Community Notes (although it's not a perfect tool, it's far more neutral than any previous ""fact-checker""). 

He banned people for disagreeing with him. He banned an account that posted every time a Tesla caught fire. So we know that his version of free speech isn't really free.

>The hype around Threads was only because they hate Musk, and none of these people actually

It probably didn't help that Musk ruined the website but this is basic capitalism. Musk is suck a fuck up. He made someone who's taken part of genocide look good.

>would assist them in advancing political objectives and allow them to freely spread their own misinformation. 

It actively bans people for speeding misinformation. I feel like the complaints here are secretly about who those people have been.

>People rant about this because they're clinging for any reason to hate and to try to justify their viewpoint that Twitter is collapsing, which it doesn't seem to be going anywhere and that enrages them.

"Rightist creeps like Musk love to insinuate or flat out push the horseshit notion that liberals/progressives are tolerant of or even pro-child trafficking. 

Musk several months ago publicly engaged on Twitter with Lara Logan, the disgraced former CBS News reporter who has morphed into a far-right conspiracy troll. Musk and Logan  smeared the content management team in place at Twitter when Musk took over (which naturally Musk fired)  as squishy-soft on Twitter sexual predators.      
 
Typically for a conservative ass clown who owns a media platform, Musk’s “free speech is inviolate” mantra seems to actually  cover for a laissez-faire attitude toward  the vilest content,  from misogynistic and transphobic hatred/harassment to child pornography. 

A good analogy of conservative hypocrisy is  Ronald Reagan presenting himself as passionately anti-abortion during his 1976, 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns despite signing in 1967 as California governor one of the most permissive abortion laws in the country. 

Of course, Reagan’s grasp on truth in the past was always sketchy to say the least. Reagan told  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir during a 1983 meeting that Reagan had helped film the Allied liberation of Nazi death camps in Europe during World War II. Reagan repeated this claim in 1984 to Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal. In truth, Reagan never left the United States during the entirety of the war; he was based in Hollywood, making public relations / training films for the U.S. Army Air Corps.

"At this point i consider Mr. Husk a grandiose narcissist. While i do not know him personally and am not educated enough to diagnose him, i consider this a very well working hypothesis. 

He obviously has a sense of entitlement, but i do think that his self-worth is tied to it. I believe that his followers serve as his narcissist supply. They (and the public at large) constantly have to replenish his self-worth or else he will collapse. That might even be the reason for buying Twitter. The circus is the point - the attention is the point. 


I am not sure, if the whole emerald mine story counts as gaslighting the public. He probably shows (some part of) his true self on Twitter. People, who cannot consider others as people, easily get bigoted worldview. Add to that the genius cult of the far-right and you get a person like Husk. Narcissists have a false self that they show the public. I believe that his false self was the persona he showed as the ""founder"" of Tesla. 

If their supply is threatened, narcissists might collapse and do irrational, hurried and panicked decisions to refocus attention onto themselves. That might be the renaming of Twitter. Even negative attention is better for him than being irrelevant. 

To finally answer your question: I believe that he has a giant ego. And he considers any real world critic an attack on his self-worth and thus a treat (since the diver story).

"Saw a really striking dissection of this whole ordeal recently. Elon bought a social media platform for $44b. That's more than enough to pay for an entirely new app and its marketing, to be a new competitor on the scene. Clearly, Elon didn't want a *new* social media platform. Then, what was he after?

Twitter had a massive pool of experienced workers in every necessary field. Elon fired almost all of them: people and expertise were not his reason for purchasing Twitter. There's a large codebase created by said experts, but Elon feels the app needs a rewrite from the ground up. The source code was not worth $44b, apparently. The company had a fairly solid, net-zero advertisement cashflow. Not great, but a very good start. Elon obliterated ad revenue - he did not buy Twitter for the advertisement base. Twitter was never the largest social media platform, but it's up there: people wanted to use Twitter. Elon decided to alienate a large swath of users, and drives away new engagement. Elon did not want the userbase. 

So, Elon didn't want *any* of that. What's left after stripping all of that away? Ah, right, branding! Everyone knows Twitter, and people grow up knowing what a Tweet is: if ""tweeting"" is not in dictionaries, it's a matter of time. That's pretty much invaluable, it could honestly be worth more than fourty billion dollars. 

And now, here we are. Elon is discarding the branding of his newly-acquired brand.

"More important here. If you live in Ohio, get your ass into your local early voting location and vote no on Issue 1. Two major reasons why you should.

If Issue One passes...

1. Votes for state constitutional amendments goes from 50% +1 to 60% +1 to pass. If an issue gets 59% of the vote, it still fails.

2. Required signatures goes from 10% of the total votes cast for governor in the last election (425,000), to 5% of the registered voters in each county. Here you would need to collect slightly fewer signatures, but getting 5% in every county is impossible and depending on what you are asking people to sign it could be dangerous considering you'd have to go door to door in rural counties. You could get 2 million signatures to get something on the ballot but if you only get 5% of the signatures in 87/88 counties, it doesn't go to ballot.

You have up through the special election date of AUG 8TH to vote. Despite the fact that our legislature passed a law banning special elections just this winter, SoS still set the election for Aug to get ahead of the amendment vote to enshrine Pro Choice abortion access into our constitution, and the state supreme court let the special election go through, essentially tell the whole state that special.

"I honestly believe this is what happened. Elon wanted to pump up Twitter stock by saying he was going to buy it for x amount, then short that stock and back out of the deal. The stock would have fallen a ton and he would make a ton. But his idiocy caught up to him and he was forced to go through with the deal.

Now he is stuck with a company that doesn't really make any money and is a money black hole. Maybe he can't dismantle it and sell off it's assets due to his ego or some contractual obligation, whatever reason he has decided he is going to ""run"" this company.

The problem is he has no idea how to run a company. Every other company he has bought has either been sold really fast for profit, or they quickly figured out how to handle Elon while still working. SpaceX had people who would make Elon's dumbass requests sound better, or make sense to the people actually working.

Problem is Twitter is not like that and is very public facing unlike his other ventures. So he makes an ass of himself and that hurts the company. He makes bad and worse decisions and that also hurts the company often leading to lawsuits and the situation where the dipshit fired the only guy who could do the security badges so the next day no one could get in.

"Because he's a complete fucking loser. 

He's not an engineer, yet claims to be some savant genius. A room of competent engineers would ruin his life in one meeting. He's the type of person (from what I can gather) that you avoid, does nothing, brings no knowledge, yet claims to have all the fixes. 

&#x200B;

He'd get eaten alive in the real world. Fuck Elon. I can't stand that motherfucker. 

One of the pillars of engineering (or life) is recognising when you're wrong, you didn't think about something, and made a mistake. You're not going to know everything, and you lean on people that know what you need. Elon is a straight fucking dickhead, I couldn't imagine working with him, or trying to. 

He's a master manipulator, not a wonderboy engineer. He's incompetent, obnoxious, and quite frankly his ideas are absolute bullshit. He claims to be a 'king of manufacturing' and he knows more than everyone else. What a dickhead.

"Elon’s biggest flaw is insecurity. I think on some level, even if subconsciously, he knows that his entire life has been defined by piggybacking of the hard work and success of others. He on some level knows this, and it eats at him.

It’s why he endlessly creates new companies seemingly on a whim just to eventually abandon it for some new project. Elon wants the thrill of being the guy who builds the next big thing.  

Elon goes apeshit when people criticize him or point out his faults and the fact he isn’t as brilliant as he says he is because on some level, he knows they are right; and this fact will forever be a thorn in his psyche. That deep down, he knows he is a fraud and grifter. Elon craves endless validation from everyone and anyone he knows. It’s why he can’t form long term meaningful connections with anyone. It’s why he tried finding validation in being father despite the fact he doesn’t seem to actually care about the emotional connections that come with fatherhood. It’s why he bought Twitter and it’s why he is trying to shape it as he has. He wants an app to open that will shower endless praise and applause onto him, he wants his fans to tell him how smart and funny and cool he is.

"TRIGGER WARNING CSA

in case there's nobody else noticed, this guy was kicked off of Twitter for posting screenshots from:

The Destruction Of Daisy

this sexual abuse and torture video of an infant girl named Daisy was long believed an urban legend on the internet --and then they caught the man who shot it.

the little girl required extensive surgery and will never have children of her own - she survived.

two other children slightly older didn't survive, and they were found buried in adjoining piece of land in unmarked graves.

this was described as the worst child sexual abuse video a CSA FBI investigator had ever seen when he was on the stand concerning the Josh Duggar child sexual abuse Digital Images case - and part of the reason he was convicted.

this is the least traumatizing way I can post how horrible this thing is.

I advise everybody here not to Google it, but I know you won't listen, and I need you to listen to How bad this actually is so somebody governmental gets involved and stops this.

any country you're from, you have some kind of government official you can contact. 

child sexual abuse has no place on the Internet or anywhere for that matter.

anyone involved in posting or voluntarily hosting it needs to be arrested and tried in a court of law.

It is a colossal barrier to entry for any competitor and is Twitter's most valuable asset even though it's completely intangible.

Honestly, Ashton Kutcher should have been made CEO of Twitter cuz he did more to get users to sign up that crucial first year than anybody that works there. Threads didn't have such a campaign. They instead tried to take advantage of people's frustrations with Musk which just isn't a strong enough force to get a critical mass of people to switch.

"Elon Musk is right.  He is never wrong.  He was right about PayPal, Tesla, and soon Twitter.

Bronny was vaccinated with mRNA.

Hope he gets better.  When I first heard about this my first thought was mRNA caused this.

This is probably the case.  On further research I knew that Lebron was at first against vaccination, but then he decided to get vaccinated.  I'm sure his whole family is vaccinated with mRNA, including Bronny.

There is an abrupt increase in cases of people, including healthy athletes having heart attacks.

People must realize that this is a direct effect of mRNA.  Many people who took mRNA have much more severe reactions than previous vaccines they took, myself included.

The effects on human immune system are elevated with mRNA, leading to issues such as inflammation, myocarditis, autoimmune etc.  When I had my mRNA doses I had severe reactions, I had no reactions with all my previous vaccinations.  This convinced me to stop taking mRNA.  

When a safer more traditional (used for 30+ years for tetanus, shingles, etc.) protein based vaccine called Novavax became available I took that instead.  It was like night and day compared to mRNA.  With Novavax I had no reaction at all.

">They don't want a platform that allows more free speech than other platforms

Twitter doesn't allow more free speech though. It allows certain kinds of speech and not others. For example, people critical of Musk himself are likely to be banned, but people can use [hate speech without being touched](https://phys.org/news/2023-04-analysis-speech-significantly-twitter.html). 

>the value to it to them was only that it would assist them in advancing political objectives and allow them to freely spread their own misinformation

>People rant about this because they're clinging for any reason to hate and to try to justify their viewpoint that Twitter is collapsing

"I just saw this movie with my gf, and maybe I'll get crucified for this opinion but...Am I the only one who thought it wasn't that bad?  Maybe it's just me, but I felt like they did a decent job of illustrating the problem with both sides.  Prioritizing either gender in society is wrong, and I feel like they showed the issues on both sides of the coin.  Of course, it was geared towards women; it's a Barbie movie. But I was satisfied with they way they showed that men don't deserve to be ignored, either.  There was plenty of narrative about the Ken's being treated badly and taken for granted and I dont feel like it was supporting that behaviour.  Main ken had his moment to tell Barbie how it hurt him to be mistreated, and the Barbies had to see a world where their feminarchy was challenged. Both sides went too far, so the lesson, as I saw it, was that both sides matter and deserve a voice. And that a world that favours one will lead to oppression of the other.

"He’s on the spectrum - he’s alluded to Asperger’s Syndrome in the past. Here’s a definition from the web:

“A developmental disorder affecting ability to effectively socialize and communicate.
Asperger syndrome is a condition on the autism spectrum, with generally higher functioning.”

Sound familiar? He’s good at driving companies generally with a big vision and he takes big risks with capital. He’s very bad at understanding a social network which isn’t really a technology problem so much if you’ve scaled. He’s completely domineering as a boss because he thinks he’s right mostly. As he gets older and more successful he’s become a troll because there are so many acolytes and his success speaks for itself. So he behaves like a giant swinging dick even when he’s just winging it.

"He was pretty vocal about how he thought Twitter was being used to destroy social values and was aggressively influencing global politics. Both of which were true btw

Pretty sure he has said outright in an interview that he doesn't care about the money, he cares more about the social impact of it.

It's really not that different, rampant racism and garbage political takes, people getting doxxed by angry crowds for out-of-context clips, the only difference is that Twitter itself takes a more neutral approach instead of allowing blatantly fake information to circulate for a much longer time.

"""Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence"" - Robert J. Hanlon

If you look into his history he's never actually managed any of his businesses, they are usually ran by people who know what they're doing,

In fact this could very likely be his first real job since graduating university,

On top of that Twitter is a software company, so you can make changes faster than people who know what they are doing can convince him not to, if you want to, let's say, slightly change how a car looks it will take a long time before the changes make it through so there's plenty of time for people who know better to come along and fix it,

Like Elons job has always been closer to marketing, using his persona and image as this genius visionary to attract talent, than it has been to actually managing anything (or engineering since he also loves to take credit for his employees work and claim he's involved in everything),

There really is no master plan, just an inflated ego and more money than sense",never attribute malice attributed incompetence robert j cannon look history never actually managed business usually ran people know fact could likely first real job since granulating university top twitter software company make change faster people know convince want let u say slightly change car look take long time change make plenty time people know better come along fix like long job always closer marketing using person image genius visionary attract talent actually managing anything engineering since also love take credit employee work claim involved everything really master plan inflated ego money sense,""" Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence "" - Robert J .

">allows more free speech than other platforms,

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

wait, you're serious... Let me laugh even harder.

**AHHH-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!**

didn't elon like banned the word cis because apparently it's a slur... Nice, love this free speech platform can't even call someone cis.

Also, a lot of nsfw art that gets posted gets people banned too. I'm speaking from experience...

Wait I have a question... Do you think gab is a good free speech platform?

Now let's think logically here...

"> On Wednesday, four days after the images were posted, Musk claimed that “only people on our [child sexual exploitation] team have seen those pictures.”

> “For now, we will delete those posts and reinstate the account,” Musk tweeted in response to another account questioning why Twitter had deleted the account.

> However researchers on Twitter quickly debunked Musk’s claims: Given how long the photos remained on the site, and given how many people reported them, it seems Twitter’s CSE team are not the only people who have seen them.

Maybe it's secretly a play to cut his losses. Twitter's turned into a money drain and he wants to just stop, but cares so much about his persona among his followers that he can't just sell it/shut it down. He's tried rebranding and messing around a tonne to try and break it, but it just won't die.

So, he starts playing a little fast and loose with the rules about how to deal with CP on the platform. He knows he's mega rich and won't actually go to jail, but law enforcement may come a knocking.

Then he can shut down the site while they ""investigate"" but then never bring it back. Then once that's over, he can claim ""the establishment"" of communist corporate authoritarian Democrat woke lib brigade shut him down with false accusations– you can tell they're false because he's not in prison– just because they couldn't handle his free speech.

He'll be out $44 billion, but at least he'll get to wash his hands of the whole thing and has plausible deniability.",tin foil hat time x200b maybe secretly play cut loss twitter turned money drain want stop care much person among follower sell shut tried branding missing around tonne try break die start playing little fast loose rule deal platform know meg rich actually go jail law enforcement may come knocking shut site investigate never bring back claim establishment communist corporate authoritarian democrat woke limb brigade shut false accusation – tell false prison – could handle free speech price billion least get wash hand whole thing plausible desirability,"* tin foil hat time * & # x200B ; Maybe it is secretly a play to cut his losses .

Riley also decried Twitter’s decision to permanently ban the account belonging to right-wing satirical site The Babylon Bee, which was de-platformed after the outlet refused to delete a tweet referring to Rachel Levine, the transgender Biden administration official, as “man of the year.”

Riley referred to The Babylon Bee’s suspension as “crazy,” according to Bloomberg.

“Raiyah and I were talking about it today,” Riley said. “It was a f–king joke. Why has everyone become so puritanical?”

"Elon is what Trump is: a bullshit artist.

He says things just to say things that vaguely align with this worldview.

Elon’s success was built on people believing his BS. Cybertruck is coming in 6 months. cross country full drive in 2020. invest in me etc.
That’s what made him the richest
man.

The reason he appears to be flailing now is eventually once people pay enough attention it becomes obvious it’s bs. like that mars mission isn’t coming and people get that now. I’m sure elon would “like” to be the guy to do it, but he doesn’t have the skills, vision, or focus.

Too many people have the sunk cost fallacy on Elon, because too many rich folks will lose tons of money if the plug gets pulled on the pyramid scheme.

So they put up with the fact that he sounds more
like catturd or Shapiro instead of edison these days and hope that the plug doesn’t get pulled.

"I'm not saying that Elon Musk himself is a pedophile, although many many people are questioning that given his very friendly history with Jeffrey Epstein, his frequent trips to ""Epstein Island"" and his intentional allowance of child exploitation content on Twitter, but I will say that his behavior seems like what many might consider what one would expect from a person who sexually abuses and exploits children themselves.

"Truth. All the legacy blue checks from pre musk twitter were big mad when their echo chamber was removed from them.

"tldr; Twitter is set to undergo a major rebrand, with Elon Musk hinting that the platform will be renamed ""X"" and change its logo to an ""X"" as well. The rebrand may also involve a change in color scheme and a new website URL. However, the crypto community, which has a strong presence on Twitter, has not been enthusiastic about the proposed changes. Some users have expressed their support for keeping the Twitter name and adding a crypto wallet called ""X."" Twitter chief Linda Yaccarino has provided more details about the rebrand, mentioning features such as unlimited interactivity, support for multiple media formats, and payments and banking. The rebrand comes as Twitter's advertising revenue has dropped by 50% and the company faces a heavy debt load.

"It feels silly to ditch that level of brand recognition for something that doesn't even seem intuitive.

Not many companies have been able to successfully create a verb like Twitter has. Google is the other big one that comes to mind. To ""Google"" something is so intuitive and engrained in the culture. So much so that people made fun of Bing for trying to copy it and force their own version. There is a lot of value in being embedded in how people speak.

"~~You~~ these types of ""guys"" are so fragile. I saw this movie with my fiance, watched her get emotional a few times at the relatable messaging, as well as laugh hard at the clever jokes. Saw groups of women in pink, mothers and daughters, friends, etc, all hyped like it was a new Avengers movie or something. And it was awesome to see. Not once did I feel the movie was anti-men in the slightest. I just felt happy for the women who were able to have a movie like this, that feels mostly just for them. Us men have a million things that are mostly just for us. And a million movies exist that reduce women to near-nothing. Why can't women once in a while get a single freakin movie that isn't catering to mens feelings the entire time?

"During Tesla and Space X's rise, people thought of Musk as an engineer building these companies from the ground up and personally impacting development. 

As his fame has grown and his mistakes and missteps have become very public more and more people are just realizing who he really is: A venture capitalist. He did not create or build anything and when parsed, his impacts on the tech development are non existent or even hindering. 

So he went from a scientist/engineer (in the public eye) to just another billionaire pushing his own agenda through his fortune. He went from the exception to the rule in people's perception and it tanked his popularity.

"Musk is a weirdo who is a bit disconnected from reality.

In some ways, this helped with things like Tesla and SpaceX because it meant he pushed through all of the obstacles that were in the way and he was able to sell his delusion to others, which in business CAN create a positive feedback loop that ends up with someone willing their impractical idea into existence.

Also, a lot of people in general are aligned with Musk on wanting what he wants - cheaper and more efficient access to space, and electric cars.

Twitter isn't that though - it was an already-established company. Musk thinks everyone else wants what he wants, and if he makes Twitter into something he likes, everyone will love it.

"I can't speak for his intelligence, but his *emotional* intelligence seems to be very low.
