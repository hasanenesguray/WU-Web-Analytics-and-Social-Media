"Elon Musk really out here assassinating one of the most iconic internet brands of all time to stroke his ridiculous ego. This is the kind of shit a 12 year old would pull. You're really going to take the verb ""tweet"" out of Twitter because you think edgy black branding and the letter ""X"" are cooler?

This mf is braindead and deserves to go bankrupt, although he probably won't. I hope he loses as much money as possible from this and his reputation never recovers. He's a terrible businessman. He needs to be regarded as such.",ConkreetMonkey,12,0,2023-07-24 19:01:02

"It works literally the opposite way. Twitter is not a containment zone for them, it's an echo chamber where their batshit insane opinions get amplified and spread, and anyone disagreeing with them/pointing out how batshit insane they are is at best, ignored at the bottom of the replies never to be seen by anybody, and at worst, screamed over by the angry supporters of the original tweet.

And then some random, normal person sees that tweet, sees that it got massive amounts of likes and that most people in the replies agree with them, and start to think that maybe that batshit idea is not so bad. Que some more time in such environment, and this person has turned into another batshit insane nutjob spreading their garbage.

The power of these nutjobs is their numbers only. Destroy their echo chambers and force them to spread out, and suddenly every place where they try to spread their batshit ideas just shitcans them for how dumb they are, at the very least prompting them to stay quiet and preventing any sane person from having their brains rot.",AbsolutelyFreee,5,0,2023-07-24 20:43:54

"Why buy an iconic brand just to tear it down and start a new one. Just make your own thing. Like, Twitter already had a userbase, true, but they're there to use Twitter, not X. Of course, I doubt this was his endgame from the start. He's proven he can't be relied on to think so much as a few months ahead.

It's like he bought McDonald's and rebranded it as, say, Cluckin' Chuck's and started to lean towards serving mainly chicken rather than burgers, scrapping the iconic golden arches and red-and-yellow colour scheme to make way for an entirely new brand identity. It's idiotic. Any preexisting customers are there *because* of that brand, and since you're changing so many features of the restaurant, you could have just started your own thing. True, this eliminates a potential competitor, but again, the features of both companies differ, so why not just start a new chain and try to lure people over with those new features?",ConkreetMonkey,3,0,2023-07-24 19:26:02

Even Kanye at his most manic had enough people around him to help him realize that he was destroying everything he ever built and that Nick Fuentes is not a guy you want to be seen with.

Twitter would be 100% fine if Elon could just stop shaking the snowglobe. Nobody wants to use fucking Threads or Bluesky. Just stop fucking with the formula for 2 seconds and people will use Twitter like they always have.

But he just can't do it. And its going to be interesting to see whether he stops before he actually does destroy Twitter.",Sherm_Sticks,57,0,2023-07-24 17:09:07
"Each individual post-Elon Twitter decision is my own personal brain worm, and I can't hold in my nerd rage any longer.

He's made read limits to stop scrapping? Read limiting on a modern social media site - a site that will passively load at least 10 tweets ahead on the activity you're currently on - sounds like an unfunny joke that a techy lib would make to dunk on twitter, but it's reality. He's weighing them all the same too; streaming a single video 10 minute video takes more data than pulling every single text tweet ever liked by the average twitter user, but you can do the former 300 times in 5 minutes, and the latter would take you weeks unless you pay for ~~Twitter~~ X Blue, because Elon doesn't understand the web.

Every single one of his changes is a lesson in best practice, because everything he's done is worst practice. Each choice he's made is both unorthodox and bad on its face. Twitter is now a pastiche of a disruptive startup except Elon legitimately does not understand *any* underlying concept required to run a social media website. 

Anyway it's gonna be funny when people link to media on Twitter, and the url is either ximg.com or video.ximg.com. But it looks like he hasn't reserved the domains he'll need, so maybe he's forgotten that Twitter is more than just a name and a logo.",RestaurantSmooth6131,87,0,2023-07-24 17:01:10

"He already owned it. The first company he made back in the day was a banking portal called [x.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com). X.com merged with [Confinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confinity) (which was at the time the only other competitor in the online banking space) and the merged company was called [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal). Musk was the CEO for a hot minute and he wanted to call paypal x.com or XPayPal or something else stupid and everyone on the board hated him. Elon went on vacation and soon after Elon left the board voted him out of the CEO position and replaced him with Peter Theil. Elon retained a chunk of ownership to PayPal but had no power in the company. 

PayPal blew up in value after Ebay became popular. PayPal then bought Ebay and Elon had a net worth of a lot of fucking money. Elon used his lots of fuckin money to buy himself into other corporations as a ""founding member"" although he never contributed more than money to running the companies.

A few years ago PayPal gave the x.com domain name back to Elon and he started talking about making ""X the everything app"" which is a fancy way of saying ""I am gonna do the same stupid shit Facebook is doing but with a shittier name and it will probably be even worse than Facebook because I am a narcissistic moron"".

Now he is stuck with a company that doesn't really make any money and is a money black hole. Maybe he can't dismantle it and sell off it's assets due to his ego or some contractual obligation, whatever reason he has decided he is going to ""run"" this company.

The problem is he has no idea how to run a company. Every other company he has bought has either been sold really fast for profit, or they quickly figured out how to handle Elon while still working. SpaceX had people who would make Elon's dumbass requests sound better, or make sense to the people actually working.

Problem is Twitter is not like that and is very public facing unlike his other ventures. So he makes an ass of himself and that hurts the company. He makes bad and worse decisions and that also hurts the company often leading to lawsuits and the situation where the dipshit fired the only guy who could do the security badges so the next day no one could get in.

"""Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence"" - Robert J. Hanlon

If you look into his history he's never actually managed any of his businesses, they are usually ran by people who know what they're doing,

In fact this could very likely be his first real job since graduating university,

On top of that Twitter is a software company, so you can make changes faster than people who know what they are doing can convince him not to, if you want to, let's say, slightly change how a car looks it will take a long time before the changes make it through so there's plenty of time for people who know better to come along and fix it,

Like Elons job has always been closer to marketing, using his persona and image as this genius visionary to attract talent, than it has been to actually managing anything (or engineering since he also loves to take credit for his employees work and claim he's involved in everything),

"I firmly believe there is no endgame. This whole debacle is the epitome of:

“It’s so dumb it’s brilliant! 
“No! It’s just dumb!” 

Musk has no experience in running a business of this nature. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX. They’re not REALLY public facing businesses in the same way Twitter is. Musk is, at his core, a software engineer, or a engineer generally if I am being generous. Twitter has massive exposure to engineering issues obviously, but it’s offering isn’t one you can improve through solving engineering issues. It hasn’t REALLY changed what it does for years, which is basically let people put text on the internet. That’s it. You are never going to revolutionise the core of that, nor should you want to, because if you do you’re losing the point of the platform in the first place. 

That’s why Twitter isn’t about engineering. It’s not about creating something people want to buy or use. Twitter is about people, it’s about communication, it’s about identifying how individuals interact with each other and finding a way to make money out of that. This isn’t something he can build. It’s something he has to understand. And he doesn’t understand it. 

He is a dog that caught the car he was chasing. All the moves he is making say to me that he is just turning the platform into what HE wants and that he is so convinced of his own rightness that he thinks everyone else will fall in line. 

On some level, the idea of “X” as a one-stop shop app to do everything isn’t, necessarily, a terrible one. But it rests on huge market penetration and adoption into industries where there are already very well established incumbents which he will have to compete with. 

It’s going to be VERY hard to make those inroads but it isn’t necessarily impossible. However, the way to approach that challenge is NOT by turning off millions of people by taking edgy views on social issues. I for one will never use X in any form specifically because of what a huge shitstain Musk is and I’m sure I’m not alone. 

The things he has done give the strong impression of generally poor business sense. I’m not saying he’s a bad businessman. He is incredibly successful and wealthy. Sure that could be down to luck, but I doubt all of it is. He has a set of skills. But they’re not relevant for Twitter and everything he’s done so far shouldn’t fill anyone with confidence. Getting into a business and immediately alienating a sizeable proportion of its user base is, by any metric, a dumb move.",Joec1211,2,0,2023-07-24 20:30:07
"I don't think there is an endgame, or even a plan for that matter.

He's gutted the board and placed a bunch of yes men in management and c suite positions at Twitter.  I know that at every one of his companies, someone has stopped him from changing the name to ""X"" at various points.

He is obviously smart, but like many smart people, he didn’t get all his wealth from sitting in the trenches coding for Tesla or space x, he was essentially the ideas guy and the bag man for the whole operation. 

So I say all to say that I think logistically from a technological standpoint he doesn’t know or care how twitter runs, he’s essentially using it as a rental car that he bought the insurance on, he’s gonna ride it till the reels fall off, continue to talk a big game about what he’s gonna do or what is about to happen (same as he’s done with all his other companies) and in the end nothing of real substance will come to fruition.

It is a colossal barrier to entry for any competitor and is Twitter's most valuable asset even though it's completely intangible. The Twitter launch in 2006/2007 was one of the most well crafted and beautifully executed campaigns of all time. It should be written about in marketing textbooks and studied in business schools. Honestly, Ashton Kutcher should have been made CEO of Twitter cuz he did more to get users to sign up that crucial first year than anybody that works there. Threads didn't have such a campaign. They instead tried to take advantage of people's frustrations with Musk which just isn't a strong enough force to get a critical mass of people to switch. Elon inherited Twitter's network effect and doesn't have to do much to maintain it.

“Overseeing doesn’t mean anything,” is just another way of discrediting an important role within a company, yet you’re still wrong.

"Tl;Dr: it’s very easy and somewhat common to self diagnose, sometimes ending it there, sometimes as a precursor to seeking an actual diagnosis.

A lot of people (especially women) self-diagnose autism in adulthood. For many of us, it’s all we can feasibly do. There’s a bunch of history and context behind it. Basically, for a long time, only very specific behaviors and differences were recognized as being indicative of autism. A lot of kids missed diagnosis because they appeared “normal”, “smart”, or “social” enough. Sometimes we were troublemakers, sometimes we were “gifted”, sometimes we were just “odd”. Sometimes our differences were internal and nobody realized we were struggling, but just barely succeeding to fit in.
As adults, we realize our experiences align significantly with others who were diagnosed young. Some people are fortunate enough to get evaluated by professionals, who can see through the mask and confirm. Some people don’t want the stigma of an official diagnosis, or encounter barriers to getting one because it’s costly and still viewed as more of a childhood thing.

Overall, Musk’s claim tracks. He certainly has a lot of autistic traits that people criticize him for (but that overall aren’t an excuse for his behavior, especially as an insanely wealthy public figure with a lot of power and influence). Either he’s had a diagnosis for a long time but didn’t talk about it (the stigma is still real, though fading and now almost “cool” in some circles, hence him announcing it), or he did realize it as an adult, and is either confident in his own assessment (unsurprisingly), or has been evaluated, formally or informally, by a professional. Or, he’s self diagnosed and wrong, perhaps playing up the traits he does have. Those traits are real though, I’m sure. They just may or may not be related to autism.",elvenfaery_,2,0,2023-07-24 21:47:09

"Elon is an elitist asshole. very similar to donald trump he grew up with a golden spoon stuck up his arse and never had to be nor was held responsible for his/their actions. Elon claims to have bought Twitter to single handedly save free speech 😭 while also banning and censoring people after realizing he could be held liable in way, just like the Twitter owners before him. He totally ruined Twitter with the checkmark sub system. there is no exclusivity which we all know people want and need to feel important. look at the hive mind of mainly conservatives who ran to get their stupid checkmark and now all you see it blue checkmark so it totally defeats the purpose of them to begin with. it's basically the same as everyone not having them. honestly I just despise the elite who openly cry about paying taxes like he did when Bernie said something about the elite paying higher taxes... he really cried saying he would have to sell stock... boo hoo bitch..",Sensitive_Natural153,38,0,2023-07-24 14:05:40

">ma il dargli dell’incompetente non ha alcun fondamento

Non so, a me sembra un buon fondamento quello di basarmi sulla sua gestione di twitter sotto gli occhi di tutti (licenziamenti di massa, la storia dei programmatori con poche linee di codice, il limite ai tweet visibili eccetera eccetera, lo shitshow è stato continuo).

Questo unito alle promesse che ha sempre fatto con regolarità senza poi rispettarle anche per le altre compagnie, ai whistleblower che ogni tanto saltavano fuori, alle idee geniali come hyperloop per risolvere il problema del traffico e così via dicendo, gli esempi non mancano.         
Ho molte ragioni per mettere in dubbio la sua competenza, mentre ne ho veramente poche per concludere qualcosa di diverso.     

La vera domanda è: si può veramente provare che sta dove sta per via di qualche merito piuttosto che per via della montagna di soldi che già aveva?     
Ah, poi certamente che sono cazzi suoi, mica ho mai detto il contrario. Ho detto che è incompetente, ma può esserlo anche facendosi i cazzi suoi

EDIT: Ecco, effettivamente concedo una competenza che è strettamente legata al capitale: la capacità di manipolare e fare speculazione, come tutti gli annunci hype che come ho già detto fa spesso, o ricordiamo anche quando ha inchiappettato la gente coi dogecoin (spiccioli in confronto al resto, ma è un buon esempio del personaggio).     
E' stato molto abile a investire un botto affinché la sua immagine fosse costruita come se fosse una sorta di tony stark del mondo reale, e questo ha funzionato molto per attirare le persone verso il suo brand.

Musk non è assolutamente cresciuto povero, ma dalla famiglia ha avuto 28000 per avviare la sua prima attività. Quella è stata venuta per 130 milioni, con la sua quota Musk ha co-fondato PayX che poi si è fusa con PayPal, da questo Musk ha preso 180 milioni, con 100 milioni ha fondato SpaceX e qualche anno dopo è entrato in Tesla al primo round di finanziamenti come azionista di maggioranza e presidente del CdA, è diventato CEO nel 2009 e da lì l'azienda è esplosa.

Non è che ti devo spiegare io perché non è successo. Evidentemente altri investitori con accesso a quei capitali o non erano interessati o avevano altre idee che consideravano più redditizie o meno rischiose. 

Io, personalmente ho un'indole lontana dall'imprenditoria per inclinazione personale, infatti lavoro in un campo che per certi versi è antitetico al profitto, ovvero la ricerca. Era solo per dire che se per qualche miracolo avessi accesso a centinaia di milioni di euro, allora ci penserei anche io perché ho la stessa passione verso lo spazio. Non voglio essere il più ricco del cimitero, come ho letto su IPF. 

Beninteso come ho scritto altrove che secondo me questo specifico settore, lo spazio, sia più giusto mantenere sotto ""l'egida"" pubblica. Quindi realisticamente se decine di anni fa avessi comprato decine di migliaia bitcoin e li avessi liquidati nel 2021, probabilmente li userei per mettere su una fondazione no-profit con cui finanziare la ricerca accademica in quel settore. Più un paio di milioncini per finanziare un piccolo studio di videogiochi :D Ma appunto, non per fare necessariamente i soldi, ma per una questione artistica, che è più vicina alla mia personalità.

> Tesla medesima storia. [...] Certamente un caso.

Il caso di Tesla è diverso. Non mi sembra che altre aziende non abbiano investito a sufficienza nel settore elettrico. Magari puoi darmi qualche motivazione razionale per cui la valutazione superiore a quella delle altre compagnie messe insieme che ha Tesla è giustificata. Non puoi neanche sottovalutare gli aiuti del governo USA.

"> Evidentemente altri investitori con accesso a quei capitali o non erano interessati o avevano altre idee che consideravano più redditizie o meno rischiose.

Come vedi siamo ben oltre il ""metterci solo i soldi"". La propensione al rischio di Elon Musk è elevatissima e questo già è un merito di per sè. Pressoché la totalità di questi imprenditori realizzati con tutti quei soldi stanno in un'isola a fare la bella vita. Decidere di rischiare una ricchezza così elevata è estremamente apprezzabile e tutt'altro che scontato. Quando Musk ha ottenuto i proventi dalla vendita di PayPal ha suddiviso per intero il denaro tra Tesla e SpaceX. Solo un matto visionario farebbe una cosa del genere. Tuttavia, non è questo il punto, perché stiamo ancora parlando di allocazione di capitale e sono profondamente convinto che Musk abbia contribuito enormemente di più rispetto a questa singola skill. Non penso di poterti convincere del perché la visione, l'esecuzione di una strategia e anche il contributo tecnico diretto agli albori rappresentino tutto per il successo delle aziende. Lo si può capire solo studiando le storie e il funzionamento delle startup, in generale studiando l'ambito economico-aziendale. Te da ricercatore (non so in cosa, ma basta la parola per avere la mia stima) hai una prospettiva diversa e lo rispetto, personalmente i miei studi vertono su questo, e posso assicurarti che c'è una percezione molto distorta del contributo delle persone coinvolte in queste aziende di successo. Sicuramente la mitizzazione dei singoli è sbagliata, nessuno si sogna di attribuire tutti i meriti ai fondatori e dirigenti, tuttavia anche l'estremo opposto è sbagliato. Il contributo dei fondatori è determinante, e spessissimo prevede avere le mani in pasta. Per esempio, se AirBnb e Apple sono conosciute per il design eccellente dei propri prodotti e interfacce è perché Brian Chesky e Steve Jobs non si sono limitati solo a metterci i soldi e a dire a un mucchio di dipendenti specializzati ""realizzate un prodotto iconico"". Senza un orientamento non si va da nessuna parte. 

> Il caso di Tesla è diverso. Non mi sembra che altre aziende non abbiano investito a sufficienza nel settore elettrico. Magari puoi darmi qualche motivazione razionale per cui la valutazione superiore a quella delle altre compagnie messe insieme che ha Tesla è giustificata. Non puoi neanche sottovalutare gli aiuti del governo USA. 

C'è tanta disinformazione al riguardo. Tesla ha ricevuto un prestito governativo ripagato con 9 anni di anticipo rispetto alla scadenza dopo la crisi del 2009 e non per essere salvata dalla bancarotta (a differenza di Chrysler e General Motors) ma nell'ambito di un piano di sviluppo di mobilità sostenibile promosso dall'amministrazione Obama. Ha dato un impulso? Sicuramente. Era necessario per la sopravvivenza dell'azienda? No. Ci ha guadagnato più Tesla o gli Stati Uniti che si ritrovano con il leader indiscusso della rivoluzione elettrica? Direi la seconda. SpaceX stesso discorso. Molti detrattori sostengono che SpaceX esista solo grazie ai ""sussidi"" della NASA. Peccato che in cambio la NASA abbia ottenuto un fracco di missioni sulla ISS a costi dimezzati (parliamo di 30-40 milioni di risparmio per ogni singolo lancio) e l'indipendenza dalla Russia. Immagina che vergogna per gli USA dal 2011 dipendere dalla Russia per lanciare gli astronauti sulla ISS.

Comunque, la valutazione di Tesla incorpora il dominio che avrà in futuro. Ha un'infrastruttura di ricarica impareggiabile, tant'è che ora tutti i produttori tradizionali di recente hanno siglato accordi per accedere al network di Tesla (e si stanno convertendo allo standard NACS), con Ford apripista. Sono palate di fee solo per il fatto di disporre dell'infrastruttura. Per la guida autonoma hanno recentemente aperto al licensing, siccome i produttori tradizionali stanno fallendo (guarda Ford con Argo AI). Quando la guida autonoma sarà matura (e lo sarà), il modello robotaxi (mandi la tua auto a fare il taxi per conto tuo) sono palate di soldi, perché è come l'Apple store, dove prendi una fetta di un valore abnorme generato da altri. Oppure di Uber, ma senza la necessità di spendere un macello di incentivi in denaro nell'acquisizione dei clienti (autisti). Il business assicurativo sono altre palate di soldi, Tesla ha un vantaggio competitivo con la telemetria dei veicoli, consente di essere molto più accurata nel pricing delle polizze assicurative (che vuol dire premi più ridotti). Ed è un flusso di reddito che cresce all'aumentare dei veicoli Tesla venduti in maniera cumulata. Il prezzo rispetto agli utili del titolo azionario (metrica principale usata per valutare un investimento) oramai non è neanche così alto. NVIDIA, AMD e Amazon sono molto più care al momento per esempio. 

>Prima di tutto, in quanto Europeo non mi inserirei nell' ""andremo"" di cui parli li sopra. A meno che tu non sia Americano, ""loro"" ci ""andranno"" su Marte in futuro. Noi Europei, chissà. Spero presto.

Ne beneficeremo comunque. E poi per me viene prima l'umanità, poi i confini. 

> Non vedo il nesso con Musk. Cosa c'entra Musk con Marte a parte i suoi tweet stramboidi al riguardo? Se la Nasa volesse andare su Marte potrebbe farlo. Anche l'ESA potrebbe riuscirci

Il nesso con Musk è che con l'SLS della NASA, costato l'ira di Dio e tempi biblici, saremo in grado di fare una toccata e fuga (forse). Con la starship di Musk stabiliremo una colonia (che richiede la riutilizzabilità dei razzi). Mi preme sottolineare di nuovo il tuo modo di ragionare molto ottimista, per usare un eufemismo. Sbra come che potessimo fare un salto nella scala Kardashiev ma ci stiamo trattenendo per non si sa bene quale motivo. ""se volesse"", ""se avesse i soldi"". Con i se e con i ma non si fa nulla.

"Nah, it's all because he wants to pretend that his failed company from the late '90s, [x.com](https://x.com), is still around and successful.

Which, well, it isn't and it wasn't.  It failed, because it had zero products that anyone actually wanted, but had loads of money — because Daddy Musk got rich off Apartheid and his Emerald Mine — meaning that when a company called Confinity found that one of *their* products (PayPal) was getting really popular, but they didn't have the up-front money to expand fast enough to capture all that interest/business, the two companies merged.  Elon insisted that he be listed as a founder of PayPal (despite it existing before he got involved), and that the merged company still be called ""[x.com](https://x.com)"" (despite the only thing they provided being the money, not any of the products or customers).  However, users/customers thought that that name was stupid, and vaguely pornographic, so the company was quickly renamed to ""PayPal Inc"", and Musk was kicked out.

&#x200B;

He's an Investor, not an Innovator.  And his every attempt to pretend otherwise ends in disaster.  He could have lead a far more successful, and popular, life if he had just admitted that and stuck to being an Angel Investor for people who *actually* have good ideas for products/businesses.",Kronocidal,4,0,2023-07-24 11:10:15

"Unfortunately, it's no longer possible to upvote/downvote this comment to indicate whether or not you think this post sucks.

Why?

Because the Reddit Admins have decided that [they want to kill off all 3rd-party apps](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), [3rd-party bots, and everything else that makes Reddit barely usable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/). And, of course, that includes bots such as [\/u\/QualityVote](http://reddit.com/user/QualityVote), [\/u\/SaveVideo](http://reddit.com/user/SaveVideo), [\/u\/AuddBot](http://reddit.com/user/AuddBot), etc.

So you'll just have to put up with automod and a worse overall user experience in the meantime.

^(Can't wait for everywhere to get flooded by spam when the admins finally kill off the moderation bots that we rely on to prevent spambots)

If you have any complaints, direct them at [the reddit admins instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), because they're the ones seeking to ruin everyone's user experience.

Again. Im a CONSERVATIVE on REDDIT. Clearly i dont live in an echo chamber. I dont know why you refuse to understand this and continue to strawman me. Is this a conservative sub? No. Am I here? Yes. therefore, I dont live in echo chambers. Its really that simple.

"C'est pas non plus tout à fait ça, de ce que j'ai compris.

Dans certains pays d'Afrique (notamment Cameroun et Namibie), il y a peu de mines formelles au sens où on l'entend, des trucs qui ressembleraient à des carrières à ciel ouvert avec pelleteuses et marteaux-piqueurs quoi. A la place, il y a des gens qui parcourent la brousse à la recherche de filons plus-ou-moins à ciel ouvert.

Ces gars sont aidés, affrétés et parfois équipés par des mecs qui rachètent les pierres qu'ils trouvent, les empaquètent, les assurent et les revendent soit sur le marché sudaf', soit aux Pays-Bas pour De Beers ou les autres grands diamantaires. Ces gens se donnent des noms pompeux genre ""Bureau d'exploitation"", ""bureau de logistique"", ""centrale de diamanterie"", mais ce sont des mercenaires de la brousse comme tous les autres.

Et crois-moi, pour avoir bossé avec un mec qui gérait un ""bureau d'exploitation"" de diamants à Bangui, ils brassent des sommes surréalistes.

Selon [les déclarations d'Errol Musk lui-même](https://futurism.com/elon-musk-dad-emerald-mine), c'était un peu ça qu'il faisait : Il s'était mis en business avec un Italien et ils payaient des prospecteurs indépendants qui allaient piocher dans un filon d'émeraudes en Zambie. Ce n'est pas ""une mine d'émeraudes"", mais c'est assez rémunérateur pour qu'Elon ait commencé avec le cul bordé de cuillères en argent.",SowetoNecklace,30,0,2023-07-24 07:23:26
"Tu joues un peu abusivement sur un détail sémantique pour masquer le fond; t'es pas actionnaire majoritaire d'Airbus et t'en tires pas une rente qui t'épargne de devoir perdre du temps à travailler.

Mais si tu préfères son père était ""co-propriétaire"" de la ""mine"" (qu'il dit que c'est pas une mine parce que c'était une ""formation rocheuse"" :clown: ). A contrario que tu n'es pas copropriétaire d'airbus.

Achat qu'il a financé en revendant un avion à la base, donc clairement c'était pas des prolo; surtout avec la daronne mannequin qui surf sur son capital mannequinat pour vendre ses bouquins et produit de son activité de diététicienne.

&#x200B;

Et pour la mine, de l’aveu même du daron de Musk qui soutient qu'ils avaient tellement de thunes grâce aux émeraudes qu'il pouvait pas fermer son coffre fort (m'étonnerait que ça soit à prendre au premier degré mais bon.. clairement ça marchait bien selon sa version à lui); et qu'il envoyait régulièrement de l'argent à ses fils pour les financer. Comme Musk prétendait que c'est lui qui maintenait son père à flot, c'est marrant quand même.

&#x200B;

Mais c'est drôle parce que peut être bien qu'Elon a nié ces info pour soigner son image de self-made justement, mais son propre père la contredit pour raconter son histoire à lui mais autant y'a cette préférence quand même appuyer la version d'Elon; sans que ça change rien au fait que ce sont des énormes privilégiés qui essaient de minimiser leur départ plus aisé dans la vie et sont fier d'être riche mais ont honte d'avoir pas démarré pauvre.

"Juste pour l'anecdote : 

&#x200B;

Une fois je me suis retrouvé à faire un blablacar avec un gamin d'une vingtaine d'années qui venait faire ses études en France (études de commerce). Il venait de Guinée Conakry et m'expliquait que sa famille était dans l'extraction du diamant et qu'on l'avait envoyé faire des études de commerce en Europe pour pouvoir faciliter la revente de ce genre de produits (et court-circuiter les intermédiaires). J'étais évidemment un peu dubitatif, mais là il commence à me montrer les photos que son frangin lui envoie sur Messenger (on était tous les deux passagers à l'arrière de la voiture). 

Et là, je vois des photos de cailloux gros comme des oeufs de caille. Il m'explique que le diamant de Guinée est peu réputé chez les joalliers et qu'il est surtout utilisé dans l'industrie mais qu'on trouve quand même parfois de belles pièces. Et il commence à me faire un cours sur les diamants. Du coup, je le questionne un peu et il m'explique qu'en gros l'extraction de diamant en Guinée c'est administrativement très simple mais logistiquement très compliqué. Sa famille est entièrement dans le business de l'extraction. Pour acheminer et entretenir les machines nécessaires à l'extraction, il y a des coûts gigantesques. Et il m'explique qu'en gros, des membres de sa famille prospectent en surface et quand ils trouvent un endroit potentiellement intéressant, ils mettent en branle toute la machinerie. 

Il m'expliquait qu'il y a plein d'arrangements avec les responsables locaux : si on veut pouvoir s'installer quelque part et creuser, il faut d'abord promettre l'embauche d'un certain nombre d'ouvriers locaux. Et avec ces ouvriers, il y a un intéressement pour ceux qui trouveraient les plus grosses pièces. Pour éviter la fauche de gros cailloux, les contremaitres proposent des primes en nature (carburant voire véhicules). 

Le mec m'expliquait aussi qu'ils n'allaient pas creuser très profond et que c'était plus intéressant de multiplier les zones d'extraction vu le matériel qu'ils avaient. 

En gros, les choses avaient l'air assez simple niveau légalité. 

Je n'ai aucun moyen de vérifier les dires du gamin. Mais vu les photos qu'il m'a montré et les détails qu'il donnait, ça avait l'air plutôt crédible.",morinl,9,0,2023-07-24 08:52:51
