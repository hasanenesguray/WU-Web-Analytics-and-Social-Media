I just realised that the episode of Futurama where Bender gets shot out a space ship and floats through space is basically the film Gravity
Gravity is not a good film
Gravity , a very good film, better than what I was expecting....
finally watched gravity, what an absolutely incredible film
Gravity Review- 40%. A+ visuals, F script, arrogant "artsy" filmmaking, painfully slow, like a 2 long short film, unwatchable in non-3D
#Gravity has to be the most stressful film I've ever seen! #Shocking.
Gravity is a much better film than I anticipated, and watching it on DVD makes me really appreciate not seeing it in 3D.
Just cried my eyes out at Gravity. What an incredible film!

The film Gravity is absolutely amazing.
That Gravity film weren't too bad
Gonna watch gravity tonight... heard its an amazing film
this airplane has Gravity as a film option that seems like a HORRID idea
Initial thought after watching Gravity: WHO THE FUCK BLOWS UP A SATELLITE?
(Great film nonetheless)
Gravity is the most stressful film ever made
Gravity is by far the most intense movie I have ever seen! such a great film!🙌
Gravity was a really cool film
Finally saw Gravity! Not my favorite film ever, but all those anti-gravity shots were real amazing!
Finally saw Gravity &amp; it's just as amazing as everyone says it is. Such a good film.

“@mwasmiff: Just watched #gravity what a film!”

😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hear the film Gravity's good. I haven't seen it yet but I hear it gets pretty... heavy.
GRAVITY: The most breathtaking, engrossing and genuinely cinematic film I've seen for a long, long time. For me, this exceeded the hype.
Gravity, most overrated film I've come across, cliches all over the place, a weak effort at pulling the heartstrings and Sandra Bullock.
Thinking of going to see Gravity tonight. Thoughts? Good film? Waste of money?
I'm gonna tweet for a while about the illogical things I saw in the film Gravity
Well that aged me ninety years. Amazing film. #gravity
Hmm not sure what I think of the film Gravity. It's beautiful visually but it's cut way short! Clooney isn't in it long enough!
Literally the most illogical film I've ever come across. Anyone who thinks Gravity is good has had a shocker

Went to see Gravity at the cinema tonight. Good film. Still not a huge fan of 3D though. I find it bit of a distraction.

I can now buy the film Gravity for my phone, since this was a 3D large screen epic isn't going to look like Jetpac on a mobile?
gravity is such an amazing film
I saw Gravity in theaters for the second time. That film and the score are seriously one of my few reasons for living.
Watching all these special features make me realise that Gravity is a far deeper film than people give it credit for.

Gravity! Top film
The film Gravity is slightly disturbing    🌎🚀😐
Gravity is a class film, so many people have slated it, but I really enjoyed it!

Tonight's film, Gravity.

Very disappointed in gravity film!
RT @Cecil_67: 20 minutes into gravity and already had enough how that film won an oscar is beyond me #shockingfilm
@rurpeth But I hope Interstellar's the film that finally gets Nolan some proper Oscar recognition. Could be this year's Gravity.
I'll admit, I was sceptical, but Gravity is a truly awesome film
Well, that was some pretty weak dialogue but, overall, not a bad film. Great premise - Scared the hell outta me. Love Alfonso. &lt;3 #Gravity
40 minutes in to Gravity..... Surely I'm not the only one who wonders how the hell this film won so many awards??
