12,"Re Episode 4. When Kathleen was interrogating that detainee and she turns and looks at the old FEDRA poster which said detainees have a right to a lawyer. 

I find that really interesting for two reasons:

1. It suggests that there was a time, perhaps only for a little while, when FEDRA attempted to keep up the illusion of it being a democratic and constitutional authority that respected its citizens right to a fair trial.

2. I find it really funny that, in the middle of the apocalypse, there would be a criminal defence attorney, probably in worn out and unwashed shirt and tie, who‚Äôs scurrying about the Kansas city QZ and being paid in ration cards to give advice to suspected firefly conspirators that they were fucked.",2023-02-09 00:30:13,dtzuc1,31

16,"I watched the first episode twice and I‚Äôm probably going to watch it again because it was so well made that there‚Äôs slight of hand tricks that you can easily miss but upon seeing once more, it‚Äôs absolutely ingenious. I don‚Äôt like gore so the subtlety of the blood drips, people frantically running, PTSD flashbacks and the tiny bites were absolutely effective and not overdone. It was ugly, chilling, sad and defiantly true to the video game. I watched the intro to the games I played on Playstation and it was crazy how the adaptation followed the narrarative of the original video game series but with refreshingly new concepts. One thing that‚Äôs very interesting to me is that the actress who played Marlene originally auditioned to voice the character in the game but didn‚Äôt get the gig. She went for the adaptation and got it and she couldn‚Äôt be a better fit for the role. Upon seeing it again I noticed that Joel and Sarah declined the food offerings from their neighbors in the the initial scenes before the pandemic began. The fungus is spread primarily through food that has enough cordyceps in it to infect the host, or of course by an old fashioned bite. The most terrifying thing about this storyline is that it could happen. We‚Äôre still dealing with COVID-19, so the release of this adaptation couldn‚Äôt anymore relatable. I hope that a fungus never adapts to infect a host with a blood temp above 95 degrees.",2023-01-16 20:59:13,stillwatersrunfast,77

I also appreciated the shift from just getting the guns from Robert to getting the battery, 'cause Joel needs to get Tommy back. It makes it much more personal and relatable.

I was a bit on the fence about Bella, because Ashley did such an amazing job, but I was wrong, Bella does everything we expect Ellie to do.

Edited, as I forgot to mention the music! I was so happy to hear the tunes I heard in the game and also now I can't get Never Let Me Down out of my head. Just perfect.

Where was the deer? And the horse is just laying in there with no attempt to be skinned and prepared. David enjoyed being cannibal. He has been doing this for a while.


I think we also got a really good view of the difference between Joel and David. Both were around during the collapse. Both did some bad stuff. Tommy eludes to how guilty he was over what they did. Bill has a strong idea of the type of man Joel was. I mean anyone who made it this far likely does not have clean hands. But I don‚Äôt think Joel enjoyed it, David did he loved the power.

I played the game when it first released and was very skeptical that they were going to be able to pull it off. I think the director hit a grand slam with his decisions on what to change and stay faithful to so far. 

The prosthetics team deserves an Oscar or golden globe, whatever award is for tv. They nailed their design choices especially in episode 2. 

I‚Äôm also glad they adjusted certain story line aspects to keep us engaged. Some things just wouldn‚Äôt make sense when put in real world scenarios. I am also extremely pleased with the acting, specifically from Pedro. He his batting 1000 so far in recent years.",2023-01-25 06:41:58,Pacattack57,14

44,"Ignore the username. Review: First episode is fucking amazing and one of the best pilot episodes of television history. The opening of episode two was also really good at portraying the horror of the reality of the infection of cordyceps. But there was hardly any sign of infected aside from episode five. So what happened? Also, after one of the episodes, there was a clip of one of the writers talking about how viewers would be rewarded for paying attention to the bread in episode one but It isn't brought up again and if it was, It was hardly covered which I think is really disappointing because I wanted there to be more info about how it spread and how that impacted supply chains. Aside from that, the last three episodes of the season were phenomenal and overall, I would give it a 8.5/10.",2023-03-18 08:16:39,PeeBuzz,9

I don't recall HBO series ever being 'bad', but this one is simply amazing

I'm worried about Fallout from Amazon and only dream of it being done by HBO, especially after what I saw yesterday.

Pedro and Bella ( and rest of the crew, really ) are simply amazing. Setting is top notch, small changes from the games are I think all in plus ( I'm not even bothered by spores not affecting Joel - at least for now? ).

Bravo HBO and the crew, this is how you should make video game adaptations ( looking at you, everyone who ever touched Resident Evil in any capacity )

58,"Just finished with this. I just want to say that something I really loved about this show was that there was only one character that you could truly call an evil bastard. There were a lot of people doing bad things along the way but at the same time, you could sympathize with pretty much everyone. I feel like usually in these kinds of shows or movies, there's maniacs and mayhem around every corner and this was a nice change of pace.

Another thing that was pretty refreshing about this was how each episode was a self contained story within the main story. It didn't spin its wheels at any point whatsoever. For example in episode 1x08: Ellie goes hunting, meets some strangers who turn out to be a threat, tries to lead them away from Joel, gets captured, manages to free herself, kills the main threat and reunites with Joel. There's another zombie show that would've turned a story like that into a 15 episode season that leaves you begging for the resolution by the end, in my opinion this was a much better approach.

Really glad I watched this, looking forward to the next season.",2023-03-26 16:58:18,Zero22xx,8

I know the moment my mom got hooked to this series is when Sarah saw the old lady clicker as she gasped.

60,"I saw some ads on Instagram about this show but didn‚Äôt see a trailer or know what it was about until I watched it. I didn‚Äôt even know that it was based on a game until the behind the scenes at the end! 

In the opening dialogue of the first scene when the talk show host said words like pandemic, virus, epidemiology‚Ä¶ I was suspicious. Then they dropped the word fungi, I was like OOOHH shits gunna go down!! I got SO excited, I knew immediately it would be Zombie/Apocalyptic themed series.  It was a wonderful surprise for me!

I really enjoyed all the creepy scenes and build up in the introduction. Especially weird/unsettling to see the audience listen to the scientist describe how much worse a fungal pandemic is. They were staring .. like numbly in horror.. but like removed fear.  

There were a TON of amazing scenes, but I think my favorite is Tess‚Äô introduction of her being a hostage. Her first line on camera was SO good the way she said ‚ÄúWell, how bout we juuust let it go‚Äù CHILLS. Love this actress, I watched her growing up on fringe, can‚Äôt wait to see her performance throughout the season. 

Great dialogue in this scene too; really builds the character. Like when Robert said ‚ÄúWhat about your guy?‚Äù and Tess replied ‚ÄúHe answers to me‚Äù BIIITCH GO OFF! I knew she was enraged and would want revenge as soon as she got out of the situation.

Then she told Joel later ‚ÄúI promised Robert that you wouldn‚Äôt hurt him, but I would very much like you to hurt him. So let‚Äôs go hunt that motherfucker down‚Äù. Lemme tell ya I LOVE a woman going on a revenge killing spree.. And that‚Äôs coming from a girl that few up on KillBill and loves Neytiris feral rage in Avatar 2. 

Really can‚Äôt wait to watch the series! I wish AltShiftX would do a Q&A livestream for this. It

82,"Like Joel and Ellie, Bill is the protector, Frank is the nurturer and he will take care and save him too when it was needed.

Bill has full respect and trust of Joel, even if he won‚Äôt admit it openly. It was already established that they are working together for total of 10 years as they got the strawberries. It also meant that they did end up getting the wire spools which actually held up when the raiders attacked. The line where he ends up asking for Joel to protect Frank, as also discussed shows that they have been working and having garden parties together.
I do think Bill doesn't trust Joel cause he relates too much with him, which means he knows what Joel would do to survive as he probably had done, which they did not show but again implied, ""how did he get the scanner"" and that Joel is just surviving just like him, which is why he wrote the letter to ""probably Joel.‚Äù

The key message of the show and the games, ""even if its the last of us and the world is literally falling apart around us, we do find purpose in life when we love and protect those we care about"" just killing and surviving is not living and Joel needs to stop surviving and open up to others and start living again.",2023-02-03 17:12:58,thelazure,5

117,"Honest question for game players (I'm a non-gamer myself). I've read through the plots of both Last of Us I and Last of Us II. I can see the appeal of the first game to be developed into a TV show, because it has a very cinematic and clear plot engine (emotional bonding between Ellie and Joel, getting her to the Firefly HQ to find a cure for the zombie outbreak). 

Then I read the plot outline for Part II, and generously, that reads like a mess. Gameplay aspects aside, it honestly does not read like something that would work 1:1 in TV episodic form like Part I has (weirdly I could see it as an artsy movie on revenge). My best guess is we may see some form of it along with intros to some of the key characters in it, but a pretty substantial divergence plotwise from the source material in Season 2 of the show. 

Do we have a sense from game players on if would actually be possible to adapt that season, or do you all also expect pretty difference changes from the game?",2023-02-24 03:50:28,2rio2,3

AND he said the things we already knew about the cordyceps but later he said that fungus can infect people as well maybe because the global warming.

Somehow there's this master surgeon/pathologist who can (first try) perform the exact surgery needed to extract the cordyceps from Ellie. As anyone should know, almost every procedure has a chance of failure. Not just the percent chance of death but also in what they were trying to accomplish with the procedure. In this case all they have is a theory that after extraction they *could* create a cure. There's no guarantees whatsoever here.

So we have a situation in which there's an unknown percentage chance of success. At that point you have to ask, ""How many kids am I willing to kill to get this right?"" And our good friend master surgeon/pathologist is fine with at least 1.

Lastly I gotta say that *consent* is the underlining factor here. If Ellie had been briefed on the procedure, thought things over, and knowingly consented then this whole thing becomes *very* different.

In the Game, Joel still cares a little. He is gruff in the game because he is afraid he will end up caring for Ellie. So he keeps her emotionally at arms length out of fear of loss.
